== Introduction

This document describes the draft of the RISC-V base vector extension.
The document describes all the individual features of the base vector
extension.

NOTE: This is a draft of a stable proposal for the vector
specification to be used for implementation and evaluation.  Once the
draft label is removed, version 0.7 is intended to be stable enough to
begin developing toolchains, functional simulators, and initial
implementations, though will continue to evolve with minor changes and
updates.

The term _base_ _vector_ _extension_ is used informally to describe
the standard set of vector ISA components.  This draft spec is
intended to capture how a certain vector function will be implemented
as vector instructions, but to not yet determine what set of vector
instructions are mandatory for a given platform.

NOTE: Each actual platform profile will formally specify the mandatory
components of any vector extension adopted by that platform.  The base
vector extension can expected to be close to that which will
eventually be used in the standard Unix platform profile that supports
vectors.  Other platforms, including embedded platforms, may choose to
implement subsets of these extensions.  The exact set of mandatory
supported instructions for an implementation to be compliant with a
given profile is subject to change until each profile spec is
ratified.

The base vector extension is designed to act as a base for additional
vector extensions in various domains, including cryptography and
machine learning.

== Implementation-defined Constant Parameters

Each hart supporting the vector extension defines three parameters:

. The maximum size of a single vector element in bits, _ELEN_, which
must be a power of 2.
. The number of bits in a vector register, _VLEN_ {ge} _ELEN_, which must
be a power of 2.
. The striping distance in bits, _SLEN_, which must be VLEN {ge} SLEN {ge}
32, and which must be a power of 2.

NOTE: Platform profiles may set further constraints on these
parameters, for example, requiring that ELEN {ge} max(XLEN,FLEN), or
requiring a minimum VLEN value, or setting an SLEN value.

The ISA supports writing binary code that under certain constraints
will execute portably on harts with different values for these
parameters.

NOTE: Code can be written that will expose differences in
implementation parameters.

NOTE: Thread contexts with active vector state cannot be migrated
during execution between harts that have any difference in VLEN, ELEN,
or SLEN parameters.

== Vector Extension Programmer's Model

The vector extension adds 32 vector registers, and six unprivileged
CSRs (`vstart`, `vxsat`, `vxrm`, `vtype`, `vl`, `vlenb`) to a base scalar
RISC-V ISA.  If the base scalar ISA does not include floating-point,
then a `fcsr` register is also added to hold mirrors of the `vxsat`
and `vxrm` CSRs as explained below.

| 0x00A | URW | vxrm   | Fixed-Point Rounding Mode
| 0xC20 | URO | vl     | Vector length
| 0xC21 | URO | vtype  | Vector data type register
| 0xC22 | URO | vlenb  | VLEN/8 (vector register length in bytes)
|===

=== Vector Registers

The vector extension adds 32 architectural vector registers,
`v0`-`v31` to the base scalar RISC-V ISA.

Each vector register has a fixed VLEN bits of state.

NOTE: Zfinx ("F in X") is a new ISA option under consideration where
floating-point instructions take their arguments from the integer
register file.  The 0.7 vector extension is also compatible with this
option.

=== Vector Context Status in `mstatus`

A vector context status field, `VS`, is added to `mstatus[24:23]` and shadowed
in `sstatus[24:23]`.  It is defined analogously to the floating-point context
status field, `FS`.

Attempts to execute any vector instruction, or to access the `vl`,
`vtype`, `vlenb`, or `vstart` CSRs, raise an illegal-instruction
exception when the `VS` field is set to Off.

When the `VS` field is set to Initial or Clean, executing any
instruction that changes vector state, including the `vl`, `vtype`,
and `vstart` registers, will change `VS` to Dirty.

NOTE: Implementations may also change `VS` field to Dirty at any time,
even when there is no change in vector state.  Accurate setting of the
`VS` field is an optimization.

Attempts to access an `f` register or the `fcsr`, `vxsat`, or `vxrm` CSRs raise an
illegal-instruction exception when the floating-point context status `FS` is
set to Off.

NOTE: Vector instructions that read or write an `f` register or `fcsr`, `vxsat`, or `vxrm` raise
an illegal-instruction exception if either `VS` or `FS` is set to Off.
However, these CSRs can be read or written using CSR-access instructions when
`FS` is set to a value other than Off, irrespective of the value of `VS`.

If `FS` is set to Initial or Clean, executing any instruction that changes
`fcsr`, `vxsat`, `vxrm`, or an `f` register will change `FS` to Dirty.

NOTE: Context-switching code must save all of `fcsr` if `FS` is set to Dirty.

NOTE: Fixed-point-only implementations, which would not benefit from lazy
floating-point save/restore, might hardwire the `FS` field to Dirty to
reduce cost.  In this case, `fcsr` would always be accessible.

=== Vector type register, `vtype`

The read-only XLEN-wide _vector_ _type_ CSR, `vtype` provides the
default type used to interpret the contents of the vector register
file, and can only be updated by `vsetvl{i}` instructions. The vector
type also determines the organization of elements in each vector
register, and how multiple vector registers are grouped.

NOTE: Earlier drafts allowed the `vtype` register to be written using
regular CSR writes.  Allowing updates only via the `vsetvl{i}`
instructions simplifies maintenance of the `vtype` register state.

In the base vector extension, the `vtype` register has three fields,
`vill`, `vsew[2:0]`, and `vlmul[1:0]`.

include::vtype-format.adoc[]

NOTE: The smallest base implementation requires storage for only four
bits of storage in `vtype`, two bits for `vsew[1:0]` and two bits for
`vlmul[1:0]`.  The illegal value represented by `vill` can be encoded
using the illegal 64-bit combination in `vsew[1:0]` without requiring
an additional storage bit.

NOTE: The vediv[1:0] field is used by the EDIV extension described below.

NOTE: Further standard and custom extensions to the vector base will
extend these fields to support a greater variety of data types.

NOTE: It is anticipated that an extended 64-bit instruction encoding
would allow these fields to be specified statically in the instruction
encoding.

==== Vector standard element width `vsew`

The value in `vsew` sets the dynamic _standard_ _element_ _width_
(SEW).  By default, a vector register is viewed as being divided into
VLEN / SEW standard-width elements.  In the base vector extension,
only SEW up to max(XLEN,FLEN) are required to be supported.

==== Vector Register Grouping (`vlmul`)

Multiple vector registers can be grouped together, so that a single vector instruction can operate on
multiple vector registers.  Vector register groups allow double-width
or larger elements to be operated on with the same vector length as
standard-width elements.  Vector register groups also provide greater
execution efficiency for longer application vectors.

The term _vector_ _register_ _group_ is used herein to refer to one or
more vector registers used as a single operand to a vector
instruction.  The number of vector registers in a group, _LMUL_, is an
integer power of two set by the `vlmul` field in `vtype` (LMUL =
2^`vlmul[1:0]`^).

The derived value VLMAX = LMUL*VLEN/SEW represents the maximum number
of elements that can be operated on with a single vector instruction
given the current SEW and LMUL settings.

[cols="1,1,2,2,5,5"]
[%autowidth]
|===
2+| vlmul | LMUL | #groups | VLMAX      | Grouped registers

| 0 | 0 |   1  |     32  |   VLEN/SEW | vn (single register in group)
| 0 | 1 |   2  |     16  | 2*VLEN/SEW | vn, vn+1
| 1 | 0 |   4  |      8  | 4*VLEN/SEW | vn, ..., vn+3
| 1 | 1 |   8  |      4  | 8*VLEN/SEW | vn, ..., vn+7
|===

When `vlmul=01`, then vector operations on register `v` __n__ also
operate on vector register `v` __n__+1, giving twice the vector length
in bits.  Instructions specifying a vector operand with an
odd-numbered vector register will raise an illegal instruction
exception.

Similarly, when `vlmul=10`, vector instructions operate on four
vector registers at a time, and instructions specifying vector
operands using vector register numbers that are not multiples of four
will raise an illegal instruction exception.  When `vlmul=11`,
operations operate on eight vector registers at a time, and
instructions specifying vector operands using register numbers that
are not multiples of eight will raise an illegal instruction
exception.

NOTE: This grouping pattern (LMUL=8 has groups `v0`,`v8`,`v16`,`v24`)
was adopted in 0.6 initially to avoid issues with the floating-point
calling convention when floating-point values were overlaid on the
vector registers, whereas earlier versions kept the vector register
group names contiguous (LMUL=8 has groups `v0`, `v1`, `v2`, `v3`).  In
versions v0.7 onwards, the floating-point registers are separate again.

Mask register instructions always operate on a single vector register,
regardless of LMUL setting.

==== Vector Type Illegal `vill`

The `vill` bit is used to encode that a previous `vsetvl{i}`
instruction attempted to write an unsupported value to `vtype`.

NOTE: The `vill` bit is held in bit XLEN-1 of the CSR to support
checking for illegal values with a branch on the sign bit.

If the `vill` bit is set, then any attempt to execute a vector
instruction (other than a vector configuration instruction) will raise
an illegal instruction exception.

When the `vill` bit is set, the other XLEN-1 bits in `vtype` shall be
zero.

=== Vector Length Register `vl`

The _XLEN_-bit-wide read-only `vl` CSR can only be updated by the
`vsetvli` and `vsetvl` instructions, and the _fault-only-first_ vector load
instruction variants.

The `vl` register holds an unsigned integer specifying the number of
elements to be updated by a vector instruction.  Elements in any
destination vector register group with indices {ge} `vl` are unmodified during
execution of a vector instruction.  When `vstart` {ge} `vl`,
no elements are updated in any destination vector register group.

NOTE: As a consequence, when `vl`=0, no elements are updated in the
destination vector register group, regardless of `vstart`.

NOTE: Instructions that write a scalar integer or floating-point register
do so even when `vstart` {ge} `vl`.

NOTE: The number of bits implemented in `vl` depends on the
implementation's maximum vector length of the smallest supported
type. The smallest vector implementation, RV32IV, would need at least
six bits in `vl` to hold the values 0-32 (with VLEN=32, LMUL=8 and
SEW=8 results in VLMAX of 32).

=== Vector Byte Length `vlenb`

The _XLEN_-bit-wide read-only CSR `vlenb` holds the value VLEN/8,
i.e., the vector register length in bytes.

NOTE: The value in `vlenb` is a design-time constant in any
implementation.

NOTE: Without this CSR, several instructions are needed to calculate
VLEN in bytes.  The code has to disturb current `vl` and `vtype`
settings which require them to be saved and restored.

=== Vector Start Index CSR `vstart`

The `vstart` read-write CSR specifies the index of the first element
to be executed by a vector instruction.

Normally, `vstart` is only written by hardware on a trap on a vector
instruction, with the `vstart` value representing the element on which
the trap was taken (either a synchronous exception or an asynchronous
interrupt), and at which execution should resume after a resumable
trap is handled.

All vector instructions are defined to begin execution with the
element number given in the `vstart` CSR, leaving earlier elements in
the destination vector undisturbed, and to reset the `vstart` CSR to
zero at the end of execution.

NOTE: All vector instructions, including `vsetvl{i}`, reset the `vstart`
CSR to zero.

`vstart` is not modified by vector instructions that raise illegal-instruction
exceptions.

If the value in the `vstart` register is greater than or equal to the
vector length `vl` then no element operations are performed.  The
`vstart` register is then reset to zero.

The `vstart` CSR is defined to have only enough writable bits to hold
the largest element index (one less than the maximum VLMAX) or
lg2(VLEN) bits.  The upper bits of the `vstart` CSR are hardwired to
zero (reads zero, writes ignored).

NOTE: The maximum vector length is obtained with the largest LMUL
setting (8) and the smallest SEW setting (8), so VLMAX_max = 8*VLEN/8
= VLEN.  For example, for VLEN=256, `vstart` would have 8 bits to
represent indices from 0 through 255.

The `vstart` CSR is writable by unprivileged code, but non-zero
`vstart` values may cause vector instructions to run substantially
slower on some implementations, so `vstart` should not be used by
application programmers.  A few vector instructions cannot be
executed with a non-zero `vstart` value and will raise an illegal
instruction exception as defined below.

Implementations are permitted to raise illegal instruction exceptions when
attempting to execute a vector instruction with a value of `vstart` that the
implementation can never produce when executing that same instruction with
the same `vtype` setting.

NOTE: For example, some implementations will never take interrupts during
execution of a vector arithmetic instruction, instead waiting until the
instruction completes to take the interrupt.  Such implementations are
permitted to raise an illegal instruction exception when attempting to execute
a vector arithmetic instruction when `vstart` is nonzero.

=== Vector Fixed-Point Rounding Mode Register `vxrm`

The vector fixed-point rounding-mode register holds a two-bit
read-write rounding-mode field.  The vector fixed-point rounding-mode
is given a separate CSR address to allow independent access, but is
also reflected as a field in the upper bits of `fcsr`.  Systems
without floating-point must add `fcsr` when adding the vector
extension.

The fixed-point rounding algorithm is specified as follows.
Suppose the pre-rounding result is `v`, and `d` bits of that result are to be
rounded off.
Then the rounded result is `(v >> d) + r`, where `r` depends on the rounding
mode as specified in the following table.

.vxrm encoding
[cols="1,1,4,10,5"]
[%autowidth]
|===
2+| Bits [1:0] | Abbreviation | Rounding Mode | Rounding increment, `r`

| 0 | 0 | rnu | round-to-nearest-up (add +0.5 LSB)          | `v[d-1]`
| 0 | 1 | rne | round-to-nearest-even                       | `v[d-1] & (v[d-2:0]{ne}0 \| v[d])`
| 1 | 0 | rdn | round-down (truncate)                       | `0`
| 1 | 1 | rod | round-to-odd (OR bits into LSB, aka "jam")  | `!v[d] & v[d-1:0]{ne}0`
|===

The rounding functions:
----
roundoff_unsigned(v, d) = (unsigned(v) >> d) + r
roundoff_signed(v, d) = (signed(v) >> d) + r
----
are used to represent this operation in the instruction descriptions below.

Bits[XLEN-1:2] should be written as zeros.

NOTE: The rounding mode can be set with a single `csrwi` instruction.

=== Vector Fixed-Point Saturation Flag `vxsat`

The `vxsat` CSR holds a single read-write bit that indicates if a
fixed-point instruction has had to saturate an output value to fit
into a destination format.

The `vxsat` bit is mirrored in the upper bits of `fcsr`.

=== Vector Fixed-Point Fields in `fcsr`

The `vxrm` and `vxsat` separate CSRs can also be accessed via fields
in the floating-point CSR, `fcsr`.  The `fcsr` register must be added
to systems without floating-point that add a vector extension.

|  4:0 | fflags | Floating-point accrued exception flags
|===

NOTE: The fields are packed into `fcsr` to make context-save/restore
faster.

=== State of Vector Extension at Reset

The vector extension must have a consistent state at reset.  In
particular, `vtype` and `vl` must have values that can be read and
then restored with a single `vsetvl` instruction.

NOTE: It is recommended that at reset, `vtype.vill` is set, the
remaining bits in `vtype` are zero, and `vl` is set to zero.

The `vstart`, `vxrm`, `vxsat` CSRs can have arbitrary values at reset.

NOTE: Any use of the vector unit will require an initial `vsetvl{i}`,
which will reset `vstart`.  The `vxrm` and `vxsat` fields should be
reset explicitly in software before use.

The vector registers can have arbitrary values at reset.

== Mapping of Vector Elements to Vector Register State

The following diagrams illustrate how different width elements are
packed into the bytes of a vector register depending on the current
SEW and LMUL settings, as well as implementation ELEN and VLEN.
Elements are packed into each vector register with the
least-significant byte in the lowest-numbered bits.

NOTE: Previous RISC-V vector proposals (< 0.6) hid this mapping from
software, whereas this proposal has a specific mapping for all
configurations, which reduces implementation flexibility but removes
need for zeroing on config changes.  Making the mapping explicit also
has the advantage of simplifying oblivious context save-restore code,
as the code can save the configuration in `vl` and `vtype`,
then reset `vtype` to a convenient value (e.g., four vector groups of
LMUL=8, SEW=ELEN) before saving all vector register bits without
needing to parse the configuration.  The reverse process will restore
the state.

=== Mapping with LMUL=1

When LMUL=1, elements are simply packed in order from the
least-significant to most-significant bits of the vector register.

NOTE: To increase readability, vector register layouts are drawn with
bytes ordered from right to left with increasing byte address.  Bits
within an element are numbered in a little-endian format with
increasing bit index from right to left corresponding to increasing
magnitude.

----
  The element index is given in hexadecimal and is shown placed at the least-significant byte of the stored element. ELEN <=128 and LMUL=1 throughout.

=== Mapping with LMUL > 1

When vector registers are grouped, the elements of the vector register
group are striped across the constituent vector registers.  The
striping distance in bits, SLEN, sets how many bits are packed
contiguously into one vector register before moving to the next in the
group.

For example, when SLEN = 128, the striping pattern is repeated in
multiples of 128 bits.  The first 128/SEW elements are packed
contiguously at the start of the first vector register in the group.
The next 128/SEW elements are packed contiguously at the start of the
next vector register in the group.  After packing the first
LMUL*128/SEW elements at the start of each of the LMUL vector
registers in the group, the second LMUL*128/SEW group of elements are
packed into the second 128b segment of each of the vector registers in
the group, and so on.

----

If SEW > SLEN, the striping pattern places one element in each
vector register in the group before moving to the next vector register
in the group.  So, when LMUL=2, the even-numbered vector register
contains the even-numbered elements of the vector and the odd-numbered
vector register contains the odd-numbered elements of the vector.

NOTE: In most implementations, the striping distance SLEN {ge} ELEN.

Different striping patterns are architecturally visible, but software
can be written that produces the same results regardless of striping
pattern. The primary constraint is to not change the LMUL used to
access values held in a vector register group (i.e., do not read
values with a different LMUL than used to write values to the group).

NOTE: The striping length SLEN for an implementation is set to
optimize the tradeoff between datapath wiring for mixed-width
operations and buffering needed to corner-turn wide vector unit-stride
memory accesses into parallel accesses for the vector register file.

NOTE: The previous explicit configuration design (version < 0.6)
allowed these tradeoffs to be managed at the microarchitectural level
and optimized for each configuration.

=== Mapping across Mixed-Width Operations

The pattern used to map elements within a vector register group is
designed to reduce datapath wiring when supporting operations across
multiple element widths.  The recommended software strategy in this
case is to modify `vtype` dynamically to keep SEW/LMUL constant (and
hence VLMAX constant).

The following example shows four different packed element widths (8b,
16b, 32b, 64b) in a VLEN=256b/SLEN=128b implementation.  The vector
register grouping factor (LMUL) is increased by the relative element
size such that each group can hold the same number of vector elements
(32 in this example) to simplify stripmining code.  Any operation
between elements with the same index only touches operand bits located
within the same 128b portion of the datapath.

Larger LMUL settings can also used to simply increase vector length to
reduce instruction fetch and dispatch overheads, in cases where fewer
logical vector registers are required.

The following table shows each possible constant SEW/LMUL operating
point for loops with mixed-width operations.

       Numbers in columns are LMUL values, and each column
       represents constant SEW/LMUL operating point

NOTE: Larger LMUL values can cause lower datapath utilization for
short vectors if SLEN is less than the spatial datapath width.  In the
example above with VLEN=256b, SLEN=128b, and LMUL=8, if the
implementation is purely spatial with a 256b-wide vector datapath,
then for an application vector length less than 17, only half of the
datapath will be active.  The `vsetvl` instructions below could have a
facility added to dynamically select an appropriate LMUL according to
the required application vector length (AVL) and range of element
widths.

NOTE: Narrower machines will set SLEN to be at least as large as the
datapath spatial width, so there is no need to reduce LMUL. Wider
machines might set SLEN lower than the spatial datapath width to
reduce wiring for mixed-width operations (e.g., width=1024, ELEN=32,
SLEN=128), in which case optimizing LMUL will be important.

[[sec-mask-register-layout]]
=== Mask Register Layout

A vector mask occupies only one vector register regardless of SEW and
LMUL.  The mask bits that are used for each vector operation depends
on the current SEW and LMUL setting.

The maximum number of elements in a vector operand is:

----
               VLMAX = LMUL * VLEN/SEW
----

A mask is allocated for each element by dividing the mask register
into VLEN/VLMAX fields.  The size of each mask element in bits, _MLEN_,
is:

----
                MLEN = VLEN/VLMAX
                     = VLEN/(LMUL * VLEN/SEW)
                     = SEW/LMUL
----

The size of MLEN varies from ELEN (SEW=ELEN, LMUL=1) down to 1
(SEW=8b,LMUL=8), and hence a single vector register can always hold
the entire mask register.

The mask bits for element _i_ are located in bits [MLEN*_i_+(MLEN-1) :
MLEN*_i_] of the mask register.  When a mask element is written by a
compare instruction, the low bit in the mask element is written with
the compare result and the upper bits of the mask element are zeroed.
Destination mask elements past the end of the current vector length
are unchanged.  When a value is read as a mask, only the
least-significant bit of the mask element is used to control masking
and the upper bits are ignored.

The pattern is such that for constant SEW/LMUL values, the effective
predicate bits are located in the same bit of the mask vector
register, which simplifies use of masking in loops with mixed-width
elements.

== Vector Instruction Formats

The instructions in the vector extension fit under three existing major
opcodes (LOAD-FP, STORE-FP, AMO) and one new major opcode (OP-V).

Vector loads and stores are encoding within the scalar floating-point
load and store major opcodes (LOAD-FP/STORE-FP).  The vector load and
store encodings repurpose a portion of the standard scalar
floating-point load/store 12-bit immediate field to provide further
vector instruction encoding, with bit 25 holding the standard vector
mask bit (see <<sec-vector-mask-encoding>>).

include::vmem-format.adoc[]

include::vamo-format.adoc[]

include::valu-format.adoc[]

include::vcfg-format.adoc[]

Vector instructions can have scalar or vector source operands and
produce scalar or vector results, and most vector instructions can be
performed either unconditionally or conditionally under a mask.

Vector loads and stores move bit patterns between vector register
elements and memory.  Vector arithmetic instructions operate on values
held in vector register elements.

=== Scalar Operands

Scalar operands can be immediates, or taken from the `x` registers,
the `f` registers, or element 0 of a vector register.  Scalar results
are written to an `x` or `f` register or to element 0 of a vector
register.  Any vector register can be used to hold a scalar regardless
of the current LMUL setting.

NOTE: In a change from v0.6, the floating-point registers no longer
overlay the vector registers and scalars can now come from the integer
or floating-point registers.  Not overlaying the `f` registers reduces
vector register pressure, avoids interactions with the standard
calling convention, simplifies high-performance scalar floating-point
design, and provides compatibility with the Zfinx ISA option.
Overlaying `f` with `v` would provide the advantage of lowering the
number of state bits in some implementations, but complicates
high-performance designs and would prevent compatibility with the
Zfinx ISA option.

=== Vector Operands

Vector operands or results may occupy one or more vector registers
depending on LMUL, but are always specified using the lowest-numbered
vector register in the group.  Using other than the lowest-numbered
vector register to specify a vector register group will result in an
illegal instruction exception.

Some vector instructions consume and produce wider-width elements and
so operate on a larger vector register group than that specified in
`vlmul`.  The largest vector register group used by an instruction can
not be greater than 8 vector registers, and if an vector instruction
would require greater than 8 vector registers in a group, an illegal
instruction exception is raised.  For example, attempting a widening
operation producing a widened vector register group result with LMUL=8
will raise an illegal instruction exception.  Widened scalar values,
e..g, results from widening reduction operations, are held in the
first element of a vector register and are treated as if LMUL=1.

=== Vector Masking

Masking is supported on many vector instructions.  Element operations
that are masked off do not modify the destination vector register
element and never generate exceptions.

In the base vector extension, the mask value used to control execution
of a masked vector instruction is always supplied by vector register
`v0`.  Only the least-significant bit of each element of the mask
vector is used to control execution.

NOTE: Future vector extensions may provide longer instruction
encodings with space for a full mask register specifier.

The destination vector register group for a masked vector instruction
can only overlap the source mask register (`v0`) when
LMUL=1. Otherwise, an illegal instruction exception is raised.

NOTE: This constraint supports restart with a non-zero `vstart` value.

Other vector registers can be used to hold working mask values, and
mask vector logical operations are provided to perform predicate
calculations. [[sec-mask-vector-logical]]

[[sec-vector-mask-encoding]]
==== Mask Encoding

Where available, masking is encoded in a single-bit `vm` field in the
 instruction (`inst[25]`).

[cols="1,15"]
|===
| vm | Description

| 0 | vector result, only where v0[i].LSB = 1
| 1 | unmasked
|===

NOTE: In earlier proposals, `vm` was a two-bit field `vm[1:0]` that
provided both true and complement masking using `v0` as well as
encoding scalar operations.

Vector masking is represented in assembler code as another vector
operand, with `.t` indicating if operation occurs when `v0[i].LSB` is
`1`.  If no masking operand is specified, unmasked vector execution
(`vm=1`) is assumed.

----
    vop.v*    v1, v2, v3, v0.t  # enabled where v0[i].LSB=1, m=0
    vop.v*    v1, v2, v3        # unmasked vector operation, m=1
----

NOTE: Even though the base only supports one vector mask register `v0`
and only the true form of predication, the assembly syntax writes it
out in full to be compatible with future extensions that might add a
mask register specifier and supporting both true and complement
masking. The `.t` suffix on the masking operand also helps to visually
encode the use of a mask.

=== Prestart, Active, Inactive, Body, and Tail Element Definitions

The elements operated on during a vector instruction's execution can
be divided into four disjoint subsets.

- The _prestart_ elements are those whose element index is less than the
initial value in the `vstart` register.  The prestart elements do not
raise exceptions and do not update the destination vector register.

- The _active_ elements during a vector instruction's execution are the
elements within the current vector length setting and where the
current mask is enabled at that element position.  The active elements
can raise exceptions and update the destination vector register group.

- The _inactive_ elements are the elements within the current vector
length setting but where the current mask is disabled at that element
position.  The inactive elements do not raise exceptions and do not
update any destination vector register.

- The _tail_ elements during a vector instruction's execution are the
elements past the current vector length setting.  The tail elements do
not raise exceptions, and do not update any destination vector register
group.

- In addition, another term, _body_, is used for the set of elements
that are either active or inactive, i.e., after prestart but before
the tail.

----
    for element index x
    prestart    = (0 <= x < vstart)
    mask(x)     = unmasked || v0[x].LSB == 1
    active(x)   = (vstart <= x < vl) && mask(x)
    inactive(x) = (vstart <= x < vl) && !mask(x)
    body(x)     = active(x) || inactive(x)
    tail(x)     = (vl <= x < VLMAX)
----

NOTE: The inactive and tail update rules leave unchanged destination
elements that are not participating in the vector operation.  Previous
versions (v0.7) of the specification zeros the tail elements to reduce
the complexity of implementations that implement register renaming. In
version 0.8, this was changed to leave the tail elements undisturbed,
which reduces complexity for simpler implementations without register
renaming and reduces software overhead for some common sequences.  A
rationale is provided in a separate document:
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-v-spec/blob/master/v-undisturbed-versus-zeroing.adoc

== Configuration-Setting Instructions

A set of instructions are provided to allow rapid configuration of the
values in `vl` and `vtype` to match application needs.

=== `vsetvli`/`vsetvl` instructions

The `vsetvli` instruction sets the `vtype` and `vl` CSRs based on its
arguments, and writes the new value of `vl` into `rd`.

----
 vsetvli rd, rs1, vtypei # rd = new vl, rs1 = AVL, vtypei = new vtype setting
 vsetvl  rd, rs1, rs2    # rd = new vl, rs1 = AVL, rs2 = new vtype value
----

The new `vtype` setting is encoded in the immediate fields of
`vsetvli` and in the `rs2` register for `vsetvl`.  The new vector
length setting is based on the requested application vector length
(AVL), which is encoded in the `rs1` and `rd` fields as follows:

.AVL used in `vsetvli` and `vsetvl` instructions
[cols="2,2,10,10"]
[%autowidth]
|===
|  `rd` | `rs1` | AVL value         | Description/Usage
|  0    |  0    | Value in `vl` register | Change `vtype` without changing `vl`
| !0    |  0    | ~0                | Set `vl` to VLMAX
|  -    | !0    | Value in `x[rs1]` | Normal stripmining
|===

When `rs1` is not `x0`, the AVL is an unsigned integer held in the `x`
register specified by `rs1`, and the new `vl` value is also written to
the `x` register specified by `rd`.

When `rs1=x0` but `rd!=x0`, the maximum unsigned integer value (`~0`)
is used as the AVL, and the resulting VLMAX is written to `vl` and
also to the `x` register specified by `rd`.

When `rs1=x0` and `rd=x0`, the current vector length in `vl` is used
as the AVL, and the resulting value is only written to `vl`.

NOTE: This form of the instruction allows the `vtype` register to be
changed without changing `vl`, provided VLMAX is not reduced.  The
current `vl` value can be read from the `vl` CSR.

include::vcfg-format.adoc[]

 e16   #  16b elements
 e32   #  32b elements

 e128  # 128b elements

 m1   # Vlmul x1, assumed if m setting absent
 m2   # Vlmul x2
 m4   # Vlmul x4
 m8   # Vlmul x8

 d1   # EDIV 1, assumed if d setting absent
 d2   # EDIV 2
 d4   # EDIV 4
 d8   # EDIV 8

Examples:
    vsetvli t0, a0, e8          # SEW= 8, LMUL=1, EDIV=1
    vsetvli t0, a0, e8,m2       # SEW= 8, LMUL=2, EDIV=1
    vsetvli t0, a0, e32,m2,d4   # SEW=32, LMUL=2, EDIV=4
----

If the `vtype` setting is not supported by the implementation, then
the `vill` bit is set in `vtype`, the remaining bits in `vtype` are
set to zero, and the `vl` register is also set to zero.

NOTE: Earlier drafts required a trap when setting `vtype` to an
illegal value.  However, this would have added the first
data-dependent trap on a CSR write to the ISA.  The current scheme
also supports light-weight runtime interrogation of the supported
vector unit configurations by checking if `vill` is clear for a given
setting.

=== Constraints on Setting `vl`

The `vsetvl{i}` instructions first set VLMAX according to the `vtype`
argument, then set `vl` obeying the following constraints:

. `vl = AVL` if `AVL {le} VLMAX`
. `ceil(AVL / 2) {le} vl {le} VLMAX` if `AVL < (2 * VLMAX)`
. `vl = VLMAX` if `AVL {ge} (2 * VLMAX)`
. Deterministic on any given implementation for same input AVL and VLMAX values
. These specific properties follow from the prior rules:
.. `vl = 0` if  `AVL = 0`
.. `vl > 0` if `AVL > 0`
.. `vl {le} VLMAX`
.. `vl {le} AVL`
.. a value read from `vl` when used as the AVL argument to `vsetvl{i}` results in the same
value in `vl`, provided the resultant VLMAX equals the value of VLMAX at the time that `vl` was read

[NOTE]
--
The `vl` setting rules are designed to be sufficiently strict to
preserve `vl` behavior across register spills and context swaps for
`AVL {le} VLMAX`, yet flexible enough to enable implementations to improve
vector lane utilization for `AVL > VLMAX`.

For example, this permits an implementation to set `vl = ceil(AVL / 2)`
for `VLMAX < AVL < 2*VLMAX` in order to evenly distribute work over the
last two iterations of a stripmine loop.
Requirement 2 ensures that the first stripmine iteration of reduction
loops uses the largest vector length of all iterations, even in the case
of `AVL < 2*VLMAX`.
This allows software to avoid needing to explicitly calculate a running
maximum of vector lengths observed during a stripmined loop.
--

=== `vsetvl` Instruction

The `vsetvl` variant operates similarly to `vsetvli` except that it
takes a `vtype` value from `rs2` and can be used for context restore,
and when the `vtypei` field is too small to hold the desired setting.

NOTE: Several active complex types can be held in different `x`
registers and swapped in as needed using `vsetvl`.

=== Examples

The SEW and LMUL settings can be changed dynamically to provide high
throughput on mixed-width operations in a single loop.

----
# Example: Load 16-bit values, widen multiply to 32b, shift 32b result
# right by 3, store 32b values.

# Loop using only widest elements:

loop:
    vsetvli a3, a0, e32,m8  # Use only 32-bit elements
    vlh.v v8, (a1)          # Sign-extend 16b load values to 32b elements
      sll t1, a3, 1         # Multiply length by two bytes/element
      add a1, a1, t1        # Bump pointer
    vmul.vx  v8, v8, x10    # 32b multiply result
    vsrl.vi  v8, v8, 3      # Shift elements
    vsw.v v8, (a2)          # Store vector of 32b results
      sll t1, a3, 2         # Multiply length by four bytes/element
      add a2, a2, t1        # Bump pointer
      sub a0, a0, a3        # Decrement count
      bnez a0, loop         # Any more?

# Alternative loop that switches element widths.

loop:
    vsetvli a3, a0, e16,m4  # vtype = 16-bit integer vectors
    vlh.v v4, (a1)          # Get 16b vector
      slli t1, a3, 1        # Multiply length by two bytes/element
      add a1, a1, t1        # Bump pointer
    vwmul.vx v8, v4, x10    # 32b in <v8--v15>

    vsetvli x0, a0, e32,m8  # Operate on 32b values
    vsrl.vi v8, v8, 3
    vsw.v v8, (a2)          # Store vector of 32b
      slli t1, a3, 2        # Multiply length by four bytes/element
      add a2, a2, t1        # Bump pointer
      sub a0, a0, a3        # Decrement count
      bnez a0, loop         # Any more?
----

The second loop is more complex but will have greater performance on
machines where 16b widening multiplies are faster than 32b integer
multiplies, and where 16b vector load can run faster due to the
narrower writes to the vector regfile.

== Vector Loads and Stores

Vector loads and stores move values between vector registers and
memory.  Vector loads and stores are masked and do not raise
exceptions on inactive elements.  Masked vector loads do not update
inactive elements in the destination vector register group.  Masked
vector stores only update active memory elements.

=== Vector Load/Store Instruction Encoding

Vector loads and stores are encoded within the scalar floating-point
load and store major opcodes (LOAD-FP/STORE-FP).  The vector load and
store encodings repurpose a portion of the standard scalar
floating-point load/store 12-bit immediate field to provide further
vector instruction encoding, with bit 25 holding the standard vector
mask bit (see <<sec-vector-mask-encoding>>).

|===

=== Vector Load/Store Addressing Modes

The base vector extension supports unit-stride, strided, and
indexed (scatter/gather) addressing modes.  Vector load/store base
registers and strides are taken from the GPR `x` registers.

The base effective address for all vector accesses is given by the
contents of the `x` register named in `rs1`.

Vector unit-stride operations access elements stored contiguously in
memory starting from the base effective address.

Vector strided operations access the first memory element at the base
effective address, and then access subsequent elements at address
increments given by the byte offset contained in the `x` register
specified by `rs2`.

Vector indexed operations add the contents of each element of the
vector offset operand specified by `vs2` to the base effective address
to give the effective address of each element.  The vector offset
operand is treated as a vector of byte offsets.  If the vector offset
elements are narrower than XLEN, they are zero-extended to XLEN before
adding to the base effective address.  If the vector offset elements
are wider than XLEN, the least-significant XLEN bits are used in the
address calculation.

NOTE: Current PoR for vector indexed instructions requires that vector
byte offset (vs2) and vector read/write data (vs3/vd) are of same
width.  One question is whether and how to allow for two sizes of
vector operand in a vector indexed instruction?  For example, for
scatter/gather of byte values in a 64-bit address space without
requiring bytes use 64b of space in a vector register.

The vector addressing modes are encoded using the 3-bit `mop[2:0]`
field.

|===

The vector indexed memory operations have two forms, ordered and
unordered.  The indexed-unordered stores do not preserve element
ordering on stores.

NOTE: The indexed-unordered variant is provided as a potential
implementation optimization.  Implementations are free to ignore the
optimization and implement indexed-unordered identically to
indexed-ordered.

Additional unit-stride vector addressing modes are encoded using the
5-bit `lumop` and `sumop` fields in the unit-stride load and store
instruction encodings respectively.

|===

The `nf[2:0]` field encodes the number of fields in each segment.  For
regular vector loads and stores, `nf`=0, indicating that a single
value is moved between a vector register group and memory at each
element position.  Larger values in the `nf` field are used to access
multiple contiguous fields within a segment as described below in
Section <<sec-aos>>.

NOTE: The `nf` field for segment load/stores has replaced the use of
the same bits for an address offset field.  The offset can be replaced
with a single scalar integer calculation, while segment load/stores
add more powerful primitives to move items to and from memory.

The `nf[2:0]` field also encodes the number of whole vector registers
to transfer for the whole vector register load/store instructions.

=== Vector Load/Store Width Encoding

The vector loads and stores are encoded using the width values that
are not claimed by the standard scalar floating-point loads and
stores.  Three of the width types encode vector loads and stores that
move fixed-size memory elements of 8 bits, 16 bits, or 32 bits, while
the fourth encoding moves SEW-bit memory elements.

| Vector element     | 1 | 1 | 1 | vl*SEW | vl*SEW | VxE
|===

Mem bits is the size of element accessed in memory

Reg bits is the size of element accessed in register

Fixed-sized vector loads can optionally sign or zero-extend their
memory element into the destination register element if the register
element is wider than the memory element.  A fixed-size vector load
raises an illegal instruction exception if the destination register
element is narrower than the memory element.  The variable-sized load
is encoded as if a zero-extended load, with what would be the
sign-extended encoding of a variable-sized load currently reserved.

Fixed-size vector stores take their operand from the least-significant
bits of the register element if the register element if wider than the
memory element.  Fixed-sized vector stores raise an illegal
instruction exception if the memory element is wider than the register
element.

=== Unit-stride Fault-Only-First Loads

The unit-stride fault-only-first load instructions are used to vectorize
loops with data-dependent exit conditions (while loops).  These
instructions execute as a regular load except that they will only take
a trap on element 0.  If an element > 0 raises an exception, that
element and all following elements in the destination vector
register are not modified, and the vector length `vl` is reduced to the
number of elements processed without a trap.

NOTE: Strided and scatter/gather fault-only-first instructions are not
provided as they represent a large security hole, allowing software to
check multiple random pages for accessibility without experiencing a
trap. The unit-stride versions only allow probing a region immediately
contiguous to a known region, and so do not appreciably impact
security.  It is possible that security mitigations can be
implemented to allow fault-only-first variants of non-contiguous accesses
in future vector extensions.

=== Vector Load/Store Segment Instructions (`Zvlsseg`)

NOTE: This is being written as an extension but will likely be
mandated in most profiles, as the operation is too generally useful to
omit.

The vector load/store segment instructions move multiple contiguous
fields in memory to and from consecutively numbered vector registers.

NOTE: These operations support operations on "array-of-structures"
datatypes by unpacking each field in a structure into separate vector
registers.

As for regular vector loads and stores, the width encoding gives the
size of the memory elements, which are homogeneous in size, while SEW
encodes the size of the register elements.

The three-bit `nf` field in the vector instruction encoding is an
unsigned integer that contains one less than the number of fields per
segment, _NFIELDS_.

[cols="1,1,1,13"]
|===
3+| nf[2:0] | NFIELDS

| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 2
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 3
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 4
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 5
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 6
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 7
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 8
|===

The LMUL setting must be such that LMUL * NFIELDS <= 8, otherwise an
illegal instruction exception is raised.

NOTE: The product LMUL * NFIELDS represents the number of underlying
vector registers that will be touched by a segmented load or store
instruction.  This constraint makes this total no larger than 1/4 of
the architectural register file, and the same as for regular
operations with LMUL=8. This constraint could be weakened in a future
draft.

Each field will be held in successively numbered vector register
groups.  When LMUL>1, each field will occupy a vector register group
held in multiple successively numbered vector registers, and the
vector register group for each field must follow the usual vector
register alignment constraints (e.g., when LMUL=2 and NFIELDS=4, each
field's vector register group must start at an even vector register,
but does not have to start at a multiple of 8 vector register number).

NOTE: An earlier version imposed a vector register number constraint,
but this decreased ability to make use of all registers when NFIELDS
was not a power of 2.


If the vector register numbers accessed by the segment load or store
would increment past 31, then an illegal instruction exception is
raised.

NOTE: This constraint is to help provide forward-compatibility with a
future longer instruction encoding that has more addressable vector
registers.

The `vl` register gives the number of structures to move, which is
equal to the number of elements transferred to each vector register
group.  Masking is also applied at the level of whole structures.

If a trap is taken, `vstart` is in units of structures.

==== Vector Unit-Stride Segment Loads and Stores

The vector unit-stride load and store segment instructions move packed
contiguous segments ("array-of-structures") into multiple destination
vector register groups.

NOTE: For segments with heterogeneous-sized fields, software can later
unpack fields using additional instructions after the segment load
brings the values into the separate vector registers.

The assembler prefixes `vlseg`/`vsseg` are used for unit-stride
segment loads and stores respectively.

    vlseg<nf>{b,h,w}u.v vd, (rs1), vm    # Unit-stride unsigned segment load template
    vsseg<nf>{b,h,w,e}.v vs3, (rs1), vm  # Unit-stride segment store template

    vlseg8e.v vd, (rs1), vm   # Load vector of 8*SEW-byte segments into vd, vd+1, .. vd+7

    vsseg3b.v vs3, (rs1), vm  # Store packed vector of 3*1-byte segments from vs3,vs3+1,vs3+2 to memory
----

For loads, the `vd` register will hold the first field loaded from the
segment.  For stores, the `vs3` register is read to provide the first
field to be stored in each segment.

----
    # Example 1
    # Memory structure holds packed RGB pixels (24-bit data structure, 8bpp)
    vlseg3bu.v v8, (a0), vm
    # v8 holds the red pixels
    # v9 holds the green pixels
    # v10 holds the blue pixels

    # Example 2
    # Memory structure holds complex values, 32b for real and 32b for imaginary
    vlseg2w.v v8, (a0), vm
    # v8 holds real
    # v9 holds imaginary
----

----

==== Vector Strided Segment Loads and Stores

Vector strided segment loads and stores move contiguous segments where
each segment is separated by the byte stride offset given in the `rs2`
GPR argument.

NOTE: Negative and zero strides are supported.

----
    # Format
    vlsseg<nf>{b,h,w}.v vd, (rs1), rs2, vm    # Strided signed segment loads
    vlsseg<nf>e.v vd, (rs1), rs2, vm          # Strided segment loads
    vlsseg<nf>{b,h,w}u.v vd, (rs1), rs2, vm   # Strided unsigned segment loads
    vssseg<nf>{b,h,w,e}.v vs3, (rs1), rs2, vm # Strided segment stores

    # Examples
    vlsseg3b.v v4, (x5), x6   # Load bytes at addresses x5+i*x6   into v4[i],
                              #  and bytes at addresses x5+i*x6+1 into v5[i],
                              #  and bytes at addresses x5+i*x6+2 into v6[i].

    # Examples
    vssseg2w.v v2, (x5), x6   # Store words from v2[i] to address x5+i*x6
                              #   and words from v3[i] to address x5+i*x6+4
----

For strided segment stores where the byte stride is such that segments
could overlap in memory, the segments must appear to be written in
element order.

==== Vector Indexed Segment Loads and Stores

Vector indexed segment loads and stores move contiguous segments where
each segment is located at an address given by adding the scalar base
address in the `rs1` field to byte offsets in vector register `vs2`.

----
    # Format
    vlxseg<nf>{b,h,w}.v vd, (rs1), vs2, vm    # Indexed signed segment loads
    vlxseg<nf>e.v vd, (rs1), vs2, vm          # Indexed segment loads
    vlxseg<nf>{b,h,w}u.v vd, (rs1), vs2, vm   # Indexed unsigned segment loads
    vsxseg<nf>{b,h,w,e}.v vs3, (rs1), vs2, vm # Indexed segment stores

    # Examples
    vlxseg3bu.v v4, (x5), v3   # Load bytes at addresses x5+v3[i]   into v4[i],
                              #  and bytes at addresses x5+v3[i]+1 into v5[i],
                              #  and bytes at addresses x5+v3[i]+2 into v6[i].

    # Examples
    vsxseg2w.v v2, (x5), v5   # Store words from v2[i] to address x5+v5[i]
                              #   and words from v3[i] to address x5+v5[i]+4
----

For vector indexed segment loads, the destination vector register groups
cannot overlap the source vector register group (specified by `vs2`), nor can
they overlap the mask register if masked, else an illegal instruction
exception is raised.

NOTE: This constraint supports restart of indexed segment loads
that raise exceptions partway through loading a structure.

Only ordered indexed segment stores are provided. The segments must
appear to be written in element order.

=== Vector Load/Store Whole Register Instructions

NOTE: These instructions are still under early consideration for inclusion.

These instructions load and store whole vector registers (i.e., VLEN
bits), ignoring the settings in the `vl` and `vtype` registers. 

NOTE: These instructions are intended to be used to save and restore
vector registers when the type and length of the current contents of
the vector register is not known, or where modifying `vl` and `vtype`
would be costly. Examples include compiler register spills, vector
function calls where values are passed in vector registers, interrupt
handlers, and OS context switches.

----


The instructions operate similarly to unmasked unit-stride load and
store instructions of elements, with the base address passed in the
scalar `x` register specified by `rs1`.

The instructions transfer a single vector register specified by `vd`
for loads and `vs3` for stores.  The registers are transferred to and
from memory as if SEW=8 and LMUL=1.

NOTE: The vector whole register load instructions are encoded similar
to unmasked zero-extended unit-stride loads of elements, with the `nf`
field encoding how many vector registers to load and store.  The
vector whole register store instructions are encoded similar to
unmasked unit-stride store of elements.  The current base
specification only mandates `nf`=0 is supported, with other values of
`nf` reserved.  In a future extension, when multiple registers are
transferred, the vector register contents are mapped to contiguous
bytes in memory as if LMUL=1, with the lowest-numbered vector register
held in the lowest-numbered memory addresses.  The `nf` field encodes
the number of vector registers to transfer, numbered successively
after the base.  The base register plus the `nf` value cannot exceed
31, else an illegal instruction exception is raised.

----
   # Format
   vl1r.v v3, (a0)      # Load v3 with VLEN/8 bytes held at address in a0

   vs1r.v v3, (a1)      # Store v3 to address in a1
----

== Vector AMO Operations (`Zvamo`)

NOTE: Profiles will dictate whether vector AMO operations are
supported.  The expectation is that the Unix profile will require
vector AMO operations.

If vector AMO instructions are supported, then the scalar Zaamo
instructions (atomic operations from the standard A extension) must be
present.

Vector AMO operations are encoded using the unused width encodings
under the standard AMO major opcode.  Each active element performs an
atomic read-modify-write of a single memory location.

include::vamo-format.adoc[]

----
vs2[4:0] specifies v register holding address
vs3/vd[4:0] specifies v register holding source operand and destination

vm specifies vector mask
width[2:0] specifies size of memory elements, and distinguishes from scalar AMO
amoop[4:0] specifies the AMO operation
wd specifies whether the original memory value is written to vd (1=yes, 0=no)
----

AMOs have the same addressing mode as indexed operations except with
no immediate offset.  A vector of byte offsets in register `vs2` are
added to the scalar base register in `rs1` to give the addresses of
the AMO operations.

The `vs2` vector register supplies the byte offset of each element,
while the `vs3` vector register supplies the source data for the
atomic memory operation.

If the `wd` bit is set, the `vd` register is written with the initial
value of the memory element.  If the `wd` bit is clear, the `vd`
register is not written.

NOTE: When `wd` is clear, the memory system does not need to return
the original memory value, and the original values in `vd` will be
preserved.

NOTE: The AMOs were defined to overwrite source data partly to reduce
total memory pipeline read port count for implementations with
register renaming.  Also, to support the same addressing mode as vector
indexed operations, and because vector AMOs are less likely to need
results given that the primary use is parallel in-memory reductions.

Vector AMOs operate as if `aq` and `rl` bits were zero on each element
with regard to ordering relative to other instructions in the same
hart.

Vector AMOs provide no ordering guarantee between element operations
in the same vector AMO instruction.

|===

Mem bits is the size of element accessed in memory

Reg bits is the size of element accessed in register

There are two widths of vector AMO, one for 32-bit words and one for
SEW-bit words.  For the 32-bit vector AMO operations, SEW must be at
least 32 bits, otherwise an illegal instruction exception is raised.
If SEW > 32 bits, the value returned from memory is sign-extended
to fill SEW.

If SEW is less than XLEN, then addresses in the vector `vs2` are
zero-extended to XLEN.  If SEW is greater than XLEN, an illegal
instruction exception is raised.

NOTE: Sign-extending addresses held in narrower SEW might match
expectations on how narrow virtual addresses are usually handled, but
requires slightly different hardware than for the zero-extension of
offsets used in indexed load/stores.  By far the most common use case
for vector AMO instructions is expected to be for address elements
that have SEW=XLEN, where there is no extension, so the decision was
made to simplify the hardware.  Software can always explicitly promote
narrower addresses to sign-extended wider addresses if this is needed.

Vector AMO instructions are only supported for the memory element
widths supported by AMOs in the implementation's scalar architecture.
Other widths raise an illegal instruction exception.

The vector `amoop[4:0]` field uses the same encoding as the scalar
5-bit AMO instruction field, except that LR and SC are not supported.

== Vector Memory Alignment Constraints

If the elements accessed by a vector memory instruction are not
naturally aligned to the memory element size, either an address
misaligned exception is raised on that element or the element is
transferred successfully.

Vector memory accesses follow the same rules for atomicity as scalar
memory accesses.

== Vector Memory Consistency Model

Vector memory instructions appear to execute in program order on the
local hart.  Vector memory instructions follow RVWMO at the
instruction level, and element operations are ordered within the
instruction as if performed by an element-ordered sequence of
syntactically independent scalar instructions.  Vector indexed-ordered
stores write elements to memory in element order.  Vector
indexed-unordered stores do not preserve element order for writes
within a single vector store instruction.

NOTE: Need to flesh out details.

== Vector Arithmetic Instruction Formats

The vector arithmetic instructions use a new major opcode (OP-V =
1010111~2~) which neighbors OP-FP.  The three-bit `funct3` field is
used to define sub-categories of vector instructions.

=== Vector Arithmetic Instruction encoding

The `funct3` field encodes the operand type and source locations.

|===

Integer operations are performed using unsigned or two's-complement
signed integer arithmetic depending on the opcode.

All standard vector floating-point arithmetic operations follow the
IEEE-754/2008 standard.  All vector floating-point operations use the
dynamic rounding mode in the `frm` register.

Vector-vector operations take two vectors of operands from vector
register groups specified by `vs2` and `vs1` respectively.

Vector-scalar operations can have three possible forms, but in all
cases take one vector of operands from a vector register group
specified by `vs2` and a second scalar source operand from one of
three alternative sources.

. For integer operations, the scalar can be a 5-bit immediate encoded
in the `rs1` field.  The value is sign- or zero-extended to SEW bits.
. For integer operations, the scalar can be taken from the scalar `x`
register specified by `rs1`.  If XLEN>SEW, the least-significant SEW bits
of the `x` register are used.  If XLEN<SEW, the value from the `x`
register is sign-extended to SEW bits.
. For floating-point
operations, the scalar can be taken from a scalar `f` register.  If
FLEN>SEW, the value in the `f` registers is checked for a valid
NaN-boxed value, in which case the least-significant SEW bits of the
`f`register are used, else the canonical NaN value is used.  If
FLEN<SEW, the value is NaN-boxed (one-extended) to SEW.

NOTE: The proposed Zfinx variants will take the floating-point scalar
argument from the `x` registers.

Vector arithmetic instructions are masked under control of the `vm`
field.

----
# Assembly syntax pattern for vector binary arithmetic instructions

# Operations returning vector results, masked by vm (v0.t, <nothing>)
vop.vv  vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # integer vector-vector      vd[i] = vs2[i] op vs1[i]
vop.vx  vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # integer vector-scalar      vd[i] = vs2[i] op x[rs1]
vop.vi  vd, vs2, imm, vm  # integer vector-immediate   vd[i] = vs2[i] op imm

vfop.vv  vd, vs2, vs1, vm # FP vector-vector operation vd[i] = vs2[i] fop vs1[i]
vfop.vf  vd, vs2, rs1, vm # FP vector-scalar operation vd[i] = vs2[i] fop f[rs1]
----

NOTE: In the encoding, `vs2` is the first operand, while `rs1/simm5`
is the second operand. This is the opposite to the standard scalar
ordering.  This arrangement retains the existing encoding conventions
that instructions that read only one scalar register, read it from
`rs1`, and that 5-bit immediates are sourced from the `rs1` field.

----
# Assembly syntax pattern for vector ternary arithmetic instructions (multiply-add)

# Integer operations overwriting sum input
vop.vv vd, vs1, vs2, vm  # vd[i] = vs1[i] * vs2[i] + vd[i]
vop.vx vd, rs1, vs2, vm  # vd[i] = x[rs1] * vs2[i] + vd[i]

# Integer operations overwriting product input
vop.vv vd, vs1, vs2, vm  # vd[i] = vs1[i] * vd[i] + vs2[i]
vop.vx vd, rs1, vs2, vm  # vd[i] = x[rs1] * vd[i] + vs2[i]

# Floating-point operations overwriting sum input
vfop.vv vd, vs1, vs2, vm  # vd[i] = vs1[i] * vs2[i] + vd[i]
vfop.vf vd, rs1, vs2, vm  # vd[i] = f[rs1] * vs2[i] + vd[i]

# Floating-point operations overwriting product input
vfop.vv vd, vs1, vs2, vm  # vd[i] = vs1[i] * vd[i] + vs2[i]
vfop.vf vd, rs1, vs2, vm  # vd[i] = f[rs1] * vd[i] + vs2[i]
----

NOTE: For ternary multiply-add operations, the assembler syntax always
places the destination vector register first, followed by either `rs1`
or `vs1`, then `vs2`.  This ordering provides a more natural reading
of the assembler for these ternary operations, as the multiply
operands are always next to each other.

[[sec-widening]]
=== Widening Vector Arithmetic Instructions

A few vector arithmetic instructions are defined to be __widening__
operations where the destination elements are 2*SEW wide and are
stored in a vector register group with twice the number of vector
registers.

The first operand can be either single or double-width. These are
generally written with a `vw*` prefix on the opcode or `vfw*` for
vector floating-point operations.

----
Assembly syntax pattern for vector widening arithmetic instructions

# Double-width result, two single-width sources: 2*SEW = SEW op SEW
vwop.vv  vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # integer vector-vector      vd[i] = vs2[i] op vs1[i]
vwop.vx  vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # integer vector-scalar      vd[i] = vs2[i] op x[rs1]

# Double-width result, first source double-width, second source single-width: 2*SEW = 2*SEW op SEW
vwop.wv  vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # integer vector-vector      vd[i] = vs2[i] op vs1[i]
vwop.wx  vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # integer vector-scalar      vd[i] = vs2[i] op x[rs1]
----

NOTE: Originally, a `w` suffix was used on opcode, but this could be
confused with the use of a `w` suffix to mean word-sized operations in
doubleword integers, so the `w` was moved to prefix.

NOTE: The floating-point widening operations were changed to `vfw*`
from `vwf*` to be more consistent with any scalar widening
floating-point operations that will be written as `fw*`.

NOTE: For integer multiply-add, another possible widening option
increases the size of the accumulator to 4*SEW (i.e., 4*SEW +=
SEW*SEW).  These would be distinguished by a `vw4*` prefix on the
opcode.  These are not included at this time, but are a possible
addition to spec.

The destination vector register group results are arranged as if both
SEW and LMUL were at twice their current settings (i.e., the
destination element width is 2*SEW, and the destination vector
register group LMUL is 2*LMUL).

For all widening instructions, the destination element width must be a
supported element width and the destination LMUL value must also be a
supported LMUL value ({le}8, i.e., current LMUL must be {le}4),
otherwise an illegal instruction exception is raised.

The destination vector register group must be specified using a vector
register number that is valid for the destination's LMUL value,
otherwise an illegal instruction exception is raised.

The destination vector register group cannot overlap a source vector
register group of a different element width (including the mask
register if masked), otherwise an illegal instruction exception is
raised.

NOTE: This constraint is necessary to support restart with non-zero
`vstart`.

NOTE: For the `vw<op>.wv vd, vs2, vs1` format instructions, it is legal
for vd to equal vs2.

[[sec-narrowing]]
=== Narrowing Vector Arithmetic Instructions

A few instructions are provided to convert double-width source vectors
into single-width destination vectors.  These instructions convert a
vector register group organized as if LMUL and SEW were twice the
current settings, and convert to a vector register group with the
current LMUL/SEW vectors/elements.

If (2*LMUL > 8), or (2 * SEW) > ELEN, an illegal instruction exception
is raised.

NOTE: An alternative design decision would have been to treat LMUL as
defining the size of the source vector register group.  The choice
here is motivated by the belief the chosen approach will require fewer
LMUL changes.

The source and destination vector register groups have to be specified
with a vector register number that is legal for the source and
destination LMUL value respectively, otherwise an illegal instruction
exception is raised.

Where there is a second source vector register group (specified by
`vs1`), this has the same (narrower) width as the result.

The destination vector register group cannot overlap the first source
vector register group (specified by `vs2`).  The destination vector
register group cannot overlap the mask register if used, unless
LMUL=1. If either constraint is violated, an illegal instruction
exception is raised.

NOTE: It is safe to overwrite a second source vector register group
with the same LMUL and element width as the result, or to overwrite a
mask register when LMUL=1.

A `vn*` prefix on the opcode is used to distinguish these instructions
in the assembler, or a `vfn*` prefix for narrowing floating-point
opcodes.  The double-width source vector register group is signified
by a `w` in the source operand suffix (e.g., `vnsra.wv`)

NOTE: Comparison operations that set a mask register are also
implicitly a narrowing operation.

== Vector Integer Arithmetic Instructions

A set of vector integer arithmetic instructions are provided.

=== Vector Single-Width Integer Add and Subtract

Vector integer add and subtract are provided.  Reverse-subtract
instructions are also provided for the vector-scalar forms.

----
# Integer adds.
vadd.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vadd.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar
vadd.vi vd, vs2, imm, vm   # vector-immediate

# Integer subtract
vsub.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vsub.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar

# Integer reverse subtract
vrsub.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vd[i] = rs1 - vs2[i]
vrsub.vi vd, vs2, imm, vm   # vd[i] = imm - vs2[i]
----

=== Vector Widening Integer Add/Subtract

The widening add/subtract instructions are provided in both signed and
unsigned variants, depending on whether the narrower source operands
are first sign- or zero-extended before forming the double-width sum.

----
# Widening unsigned integer add/subtract, 2*SEW = SEW +/- SEW
vwaddu.vv  vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # vector-vector
vwaddu.vx  vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vector-scalar
vwsubu.vv  vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # vector-vector
vwsubu.vx  vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vector-scalar

# Widening signed integer add/subtract, 2*SEW = SEW +/- SEW
vwadd.vv  vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # vector-vector
vwadd.vx  vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vector-scalar
vwsub.vv  vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # vector-vector

# Widening unsigned integer add/subtract, 2*SEW = 2*SEW +/- SEW
vwaddu.wv  vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # vector-vector
vwaddu.wx  vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vector-scalar
vwsubu.wv  vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # vector-vector
vwsubu.wx  vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vector-scalar

# Widening signed integer add/subtract, 2*SEW = 2*SEW +/- SEW
vwadd.wv  vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # vector-vector
vwadd.wx  vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vector-scalar
vwsub.wv  vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # vector-vector
vwsub.wx  vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vector-scalar
----

NOTE: An integer value can be doubled in width using the widening add
instructions with a scalar operand of `x0`.  Can define assembly
pseudoinstructions `vwcvt.x.x.v vd,vs,vm = vwadd.vx vd,vs,x0,vm` and
`vwcvtu.x.x.v vd,vs,vm = vwaddu.vx vd,vs,x0,vm`.

=== Vector Integer Add-with-Carry / Subtract-with-Borrow Instructions

To support multi-word integer arithmetic, instructions that operate on
a carry bit are provided.  For each operation (add or subtract), two
instructions are provided: one to provide the result (SEW width), and
the second to generate the carry output (single bit encoded as a mask
boolean).

The carry inputs and outputs are represented using the mask register
layout as described in Section <<sec-mask-register-layout>>.  Due to
encoding constraints, the carry input must come from the implicit `v0`
register, but carry outputs can be written to any vector register that
respects the source/destination overlap restrictions below.

`vadc` and `vsbc` add or subtract the source operands and the carry-in or
borrow-in, and write the result to vector register `vd`.
These instructions are encoded as masked instructions (`vm=0`), but they operate
on and write back all body elements.
Encodings corresponding to the unmasked versions (`vm=1`) are reserved.

`vmadc` and `vmsbc` add or subtract the source operands, optionally add the
carry-in or subtract the borrow-in if masked (`vm=0`), and write the result back
to mask register `vd`.
If unmasked (`vm=1`), there is no carry-in or borrow-in.
These instructions operate on and write back all body elements, even if
masked.

----
 # Produce sum with carry.

 # vd[i] = vs2[i] + vs1[i] + v0[i].LSB
 vadc.vvm   vd, vs2, vs1, v0  # Vector-vector

 # vd[i] = vs2[i] + x[rs1] + v0[i].LSB
 vadc.vxm   vd, vs2, rs1, v0  # Vector-scalar

 # vd[i] = vs2[i] + imm + v0[i].LSB
 vadc.vim   vd, vs2, imm, v0  # Vector-immediate

 # Produce carry out in mask register format

 # vd[i] = carry_out(vs2[i] + vs1[i] + v0[i].LSB)
 vmadc.vvm   vd, vs2, vs1, v0  # Vector-vector

 # vd[i] = carry_out(vs2[i] + x[rs1] + v0[i].LSB)
 vmadc.vxm   vd, vs2, rs1, v0  # Vector-scalar

 # vd[i] = carry_out(vs2[i] + imm + v0[i].LSB)
 vmadc.vim   vd, vs2, imm, v0  # Vector-immediate

 # vd[i] = carry_out(vs2[i] + vs1[i])
 vmadc.vv    vd, vs2, vs1      # Vector-vector, no carry-in

 # vd[i] = carry_out(vs2[i] + x[rs1])
 vmadc.vx    vd, vs2, rs1      # Vector-scalar, no carry-in

 # vd[i] = carry_out(vs2[i] + imm)
 vmadc.vi    vd, vs2, imm      # Vector-immediate, no carry-in
----

Because implementing a carry propagation requires executing two
instructions with unchanged inputs, destructive accumulations will
require an additional move to obtain correct results.

----
  # Example multi-word arithmetic sequence, accumulating into v4
  vmadc.vvm v1, v4, v8, v0  # Get carry into temp register v1
  vadc.vvm v4, v4, v8, v0   # Calc new sum
  vmcpy.m v0, v1             # Move temp carry into v0 for next word
----

The subtract with borrow instruction `vsbc` performs the equivalent
function to support long word arithmetic for subtraction.  There are
no subtract with immediate instructions.

----
 # Produce difference with borrow.

 # vd[i] = vs2[i] - vs1[i] - v0[i].LSB
 vsbc.vvm   vd, vs2, vs1, v0  # Vector-vector

 # vd[i] = vs2[i] - x[rs1] - v0[i].LSB
 vsbc.vxm   vd, vs2, rs1, v0  # Vector-scalar

 # Produce borrow out in mask register format

 # vd[i] = borrow_out(vs2[i] - vs1[i] - v0[i].LSB)
 vmsbc.vvm   vd, vs2, vs1, v0  # Vector-vector

 # vd[i] = borrow_out(vs2[i] - x[rs1] - v0[i].LSB)
 vmsbc.vxm   vd, vs2, rs1, v0  # Vector-scalar

 # vd[i] = borrow_out(vs2[i] - vs1[i])
 vmsbc.vv    vd, vs2, vs1      # Vector-vector, no borrow-in

 # vd[i] = borrow_out(vs2[i] - x[rs1])
 vmsbc.vx    vd, vs2, rs1      # Vector-scalar, no borrow-in
----

For `vmsbc`, the borrow is defined to be 1 iff the difference, prior to
truncation, is negative.

For `vadc` and `vsbc`, an illegal instruction exception is raised
if the destination vector register is `v0` and LMUL > 1.

NOTE: This constraint corresponds to the constraint on masked vector
operations that overwrite the mask register.

For `vmadc` and `vmsbc`, an illegal instruction exception is raised if
the destination vector register overlaps a source vector register
group and LMUL > 1.

=== Vector Bitwise Logical Instructions

----
# Bitwise logical operations.
vand.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vand.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar
vand.vi vd, vs2, imm, vm   # vector-immediate

vor.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm    # Vector-vector
vor.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm    # vector-scalar
vor.vi vd, vs2, imm, vm    # vector-immediate

vxor.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm    # Vector-vector
vxor.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm    # vector-scalar
vxor.vi vd, vs2, imm, vm    # vector-immediate
----

NOTE: With an immediate of -1, scalar-immediate forms of the `vxor`
instruction provide a bitwise NOT operation.  This can be provided as
an assembler pseudoinstruction `vnot.v`.

=== Vector Single-Width Bit Shift Instructions

A full complement of vector shift instructions are provided, including
logical shift left, and logical (zero-extending) and arithmetic
(sign-extending) shift right.

----
# Bit shift operations
vsll.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vsll.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar
vsll.vi vd, vs2, uimm, vm   # vector-immediate

vsrl.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vsrl.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar
vsrl.vi vd, vs2, uimm, vm   # vector-immediate

vsra.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vsra.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar
vsra.vi vd, vs2, uimm, vm   # vector-immediate
----

Only the low lg2(SEW) bits are read to obtain the shift amount from a register value.

The immediate is treated as an unsigned shift amount, with a maximum
shift amount of 31.

=== Vector Narrowing Integer Right Shift Instructions

The narrowing right shifts extract a smaller field from a wider
operand and have both zero-extending (`srl`) and sign-extending
(`sra`) forms.  The shift amount can come from a vector or a scalar
`x` register or a 5-bit immediate.  The low lg2(2*SEW) bits of the
vector or scalar shift amount value are used (e.g., the low 6 bits for
a SEW=64-bit to SEW=32-bit narrowing operation).  The unsigned immediate form
supports shift amounts up to 31 only.

----
 # Narrowing shift right logical, SEW = (2*SEW) >> SEW
 vnsrl.wv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # vector-vector
 vnsrl.wx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar
 vnsrl.wi vd, vs2, uimm, vm   # vector-immediate

 # Narrowing shift right arithmetic, SEW = (2*SEW) >> SEW
 vnsra.wv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # vector-vector
 vnsra.wx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar
 vnsra.wi vd, vs2, uimm, vm   # vector-immediate
----

NOTE: It could be useful to add support for `n4` variants, where the
destination is 1/4 width of source.

=== Vector Integer Comparison Instructions

The following integer compare instructions write 1 to the
destination mask register element if the comparison evaluates to true,
and 0 otherwise.  The destination mask vector is always held in a
single vector register, with a layout of elements as described in
Section <<sec-mask-register-layout>>.

----

NOTE: The immediate forms of `vmslt{u}.vi` are not provided as the
immediate value can be decreased by 1 and the `vmsle{u}.vi` variants
used instead.  The `vmsle.vi` range is -16 to 15, resulting in an
effective `vmslt.vi` range of -15 to 16.  The `vmsleu.vi` range is 0 to
15 (and `(~0)-15` to `~0`), giving an effective `vmsltu.vi` range of 1 to 16
(Note, `vmsltu.vi` with immediate 0 is not useful as it is always
false). Similarly, `vmsge{u}.vi` is not provided and the comparison is
implemented using `vmsgt{u}.vi` with the immediate decremented by one.
The resulting effective `vmsge.vi` range is -15 to 16, and the
resulting effective `vmsgeu.vi` range is 1 to 16 (Note, `vmsgeu.vi` with
immediate 0 is not useful as it is always true).

NOTE: The `vmsgt` forms for register scalar and immediates are provided
to allow a single comparison instruction to provide the correct
polarity of mask value without using additional mask logical
instructions.

To reduce encoding space, the `vmsge{u}.vx` form is not directly
provided, and so the `va {ge} x` case requires special treatment.

NOTE: The `vmsge{u}.vx` could potentially be encoded in a
non-orthogonal way under the unused OPIVI variant of `vmslt{u}`.  These
would be the only instructions in OPIVI that use a scalar `x`register
however.  Alternatively, a further two funct6 encodings could be used,
but these would have a different operand format (writes to mask
register) than others in the same group of 8 funct6 encodings.  The
current PoR is to omit these instructions and to synthesize where
needed as described below.

The `vmsge{u}.vx` operation can be synthesized by reducing the
value of `x` by 1 and using the `vmsgt{u}.vx` instruction, when it is
known that this will not underflow the representation in `x`.

----
Sequences to synthesize `vmsge{u}.vx` instruction

va >= x,  x > minimum

   addi t0, x, -1; vmsgt{u}.vx vd, va, t0, vm
----

The above sequence will usually be the most efficient implementation,
but assembler pseudoinstructions can be provided for cases where the
range of `x` is unknown.

----
unmasked va >= x

  pseudoinstruction: vmsge{u}.vx vd, va, x
  expansion: vmslt{u}.vx vd, va, x; vmnand.mm vd, vd, vd

masked va >= x, vd != v0

  pseudoinstruction: vmsge{u}.vx vd, va, x, v0.t
  expansion: vmslt{u}.vx vd, va, x, v0.t; vmxor.mm vd, vd, v0

masked va >= x, any vd

  pseudoinstruction: vmsge{u}.vx vd, va, x, v0.t, vt
  expansion: vmslt{u}.vx vt, va, x;  vmandnot.mm vd, vd, vt

  The vt argument to the pseudoinstruction must name a temporary vector register that is
  not same as vd and which will be clobbered by the pseudoinstruction
----

Comparisons effectively AND in the mask, e.g,

----
    # (a < b) && (b < c) in two instructions
    vmslt.vv    v0, va, vb        # All body elements written
    vmslt.vv    v0, vb, vc, v0.t  # Only update at set mask
----

For all comparison instructions, an illegal instruction exception is raised if
the destination vector register overlaps a source vector register group and
LMUL > 1.

=== Vector Integer Min/Max Instructions

Signed and unsigned integer minimum and maximum instructions are
supported.

----
# Unsigned minimum
vminu.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vminu.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar

# Signed minimum
vmin.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vmin.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar

# Unsigned maximum
vmaxu.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vmaxu.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar

# Signed maximum
vmax.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vmax.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar
----

=== Vector Single-Width Integer Multiply Instructions

The single-width multiply instructions perform a SEW-bit*SEW-bit
multiply and return an SEW-bit-wide result.  The `*mulh*` versions
write the high word of the product to the destination register.

----
# Signed multiply, returning low bits of product
vmul.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vmul.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar

# Signed multiply, returning high bits of product
vmulh.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vmulh.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar

# Unsigned multiply, returning high bits of product
vmulhu.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vmulhu.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar

# Signed(vs2)-Unsigned multiply, returning high bits of product
vmulhsu.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vmulhsu.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar
----

NOTE: There is no `vmulhus` opcode to return high half of
unsigned-vector * signed-scalar product.

NOTE: The current `vmulh*` opcodes perform simple fractional
multiplies, but with no option to scale, round, and/or saturate the
result.  Can consider changing definition of `vmulh`, `vmulhu`,
`vmulhsu` to use `vxrm` rounding mode when discarding low half of
product.  There is no possibility of overflow in this case.

=== Vector Integer Divide Instructions

The divide and remainder instructions are equivalent to the RISC-V
standard scalar integer multiply/divides, with the same results for
extreme inputs.

----
    # Unsigned divide.
    vdivu.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
    vdivu.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar

    # Signed divide
    vdiv.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
    vdiv.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar

    # Unsigned remainder
    vremu.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
    vremu.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar

    # Signed remainder
    vrem.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
    vrem.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar
----

NOTE: The decision to include integer divide and remainder was
contentious. The argument in favor is that without a standard
instruction, software would have to pick some algorithm to perform the
operation, which would likely perform poorly on some
microarchitectures versus others.

NOTE: There is no instruction to perform a "scalar divide by vector"
operation.

=== Vector Widening Integer Multiply Instructions

The widening integer multiply instructions return the full 2*SEW-bit
product from an SEW-bit*SEW-bit multiply.

----
# Widening signed-integer multiply
vwmul.vv  vd, vs2, vs1, vm# vector-vector
vwmul.vx  vd, vs2, rs1, vm # vector-scalar

# Widening unsigned-integer multiply
vwmulu.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm # vector-vector
vwmulu.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm # vector-scalar

# Widening signed-unsigned integer multiply
vwmulsu.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm # vector-vector
vwmulsu.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm # vector-scalar
----

=== Vector Single-Width Integer Multiply-Add Instructions

The integer multiply-add instructions are destructive and are provided
in two forms, one that overwrites the addend or minuend
(`vmacc`, `vnmsac`) and one that overwrites the first multiplicand
(`vmadd`, `vnmsub`).

The low half of the product is added or subtracted from the third operand.

NOTE: "sac" is intended to be read as "subtract from accumulator". The
opcode is "vnmsac" to match the (unfortunately counterintuitive)
floating-point `fnmsub` instruction definition.  Similarly for the
"vnmsub" opcode.

----
# Integer multiply-add, overwrite addend
vmacc.vv vd, vs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = +(vs1[i] * vs2[i]) + vd[i]
vmacc.vx vd, rs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = +(x[rs1] * vs2[i]) + vd[i]

# Integer multiply-sub, overwrite minuend
vnmsac.vv vd, vs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = -(vs1[i] * vs2[i]) + vd[i]
vnmsac.vx vd, rs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = -(x[rs1] * vs2[i]) + vd[i]

# Integer multiply-add, overwrite multiplicand
vmadd.vv vd, vs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = (vs1[i] * vd[i]) + vs2[i]
vmadd.vx vd, rs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = (x[rs1] * vd[i]) + vs2[i]

# Integer multiply-sub, overwrite multiplicand
vnmsub.vv vd, vs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = -(vs1[i] * vd[i]) + vs2[i]
vnmsub.vx vd, rs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = -(x[rs1] * vd[i]) + vs2[i]
----

=== Vector Widening Integer Multiply-Add Instructions

The widening integer multiply-add instructions add a SEW-bit*SEW-bit
multiply result to (from) a 2*SEW-bit value and produce a 2*SEW-bit
result.  All combinations of signed and unsigned multiply operands are
supported.

----
# Widening unsigned-integer multiply-add, overwrite addend
vwmaccu.vv vd, vs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = +(vs1[i] * vs2[i]) + vd[i]
vwmaccu.vx vd, rs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = +(x[rs1] * vs2[i]) + vd[i]

# Widening signed-integer multiply-add, overwrite addend
vwmacc.vv vd, vs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = +(vs1[i] * vs2[i]) + vd[i]
vwmacc.vx vd, rs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = +(x[rs1] * vs2[i]) + vd[i]

# Widening signed-unsigned-integer multiply-add, overwrite addend
vwmaccsu.vv vd, vs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = +(signed(vs1[i]) * unsigned(vs2[i])) + vd[i]
vwmaccsu.vx vd, rs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = +(signed(x[rs1]) * unsigned(vs2[i])) + vd[i]

# Widening unsigned-signed-integer multiply-add, overwrite addend
vwmaccus.vx vd, rs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = +(unsigned(x[rs1]) * signed(vs2[i])) + vd[i]
----

=== Vector Quad-Widening Integer Multiply-Add Instructions

The quad-widening integer multiply-add instructions add a SEW-bit*SEW-bit
multiply result to (from) a 4*SEW-bit value and produce a 4*SEW-bit
result.  All combinations of signed and unsigned multiply operands are
supported.

NOTE: It is currently unclear if quad-widening will be part of
standard base, or part of an extension.  Quad-widening would add a new
operand access pattern to the standard.

NOTE: On ELEN=32 machines, only 8b * 8b = 16b products accumulated in
a 32b accumulator would be supported.  Machines with ELEN=64 would
also add 16b * 16b = 32b products accumulated in 64b.

----
# Quad-widening unsigned-integer multiply-add, overwrite addend
vqmaccu.vv vd, vs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = +(vs1[i] * vs2[i]) + vd[i]
vqmaccu.vx vd, rs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = +(x[rs1] * vs2[i]) + vd[i]

# Quad-widening signed-integer multiply-add, overwrite addend
vqmacc.vv vd, vs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = +(vs1[i] * vs2[i]) + vd[i]
vqmacc.vx vd, rs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = +(x[rs1] * vs2[i]) + vd[i]

# Quad-widening signed-unsigned-integer multiply-add, overwrite addend
vqmaccsu.vv vd, vs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = +(signed(vs1[i]) * unsigned(vs2[i])) + vd[i]
vqmaccsu.vx vd, rs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = +(signed(x[rs1]) * unsigned(vs2[i])) + vd[i]

# Quad-widening unsigned-signed-integer multiply-add, overwrite addend
vqmaccus.vx vd, rs1, vs2, vm    # vd[i] = +(unsigned(x[rs1]) * signed(vs2[i])) + vd[i]
----

=== Vector Integer Merge Instructions

The vector integer merge instructions combine two source operands
based on the mask field.  Unlike regular arithmetic instructions, the
merge operates on all body elements (i.e., the set of elements from
`vstart` up to the current vector length in `vl`).

The `vmerge` instructions are always masked (`vm=0`).
The instructions combine two
sources as follows.  At elements where the mask value is zero, the
first operand is copied to the destination element, otherwise the
second operand is copied to the destination element.  The first
operand is always a vector register group specified by `vs2`.  The
second operand is a vector register group specified by `vs1` or a
scalar `x` register specified by `rs1` or a 5-bit sign-extended
immediate.

----
vmerge.vvm vd, vs2, vs1, v0  # vd[i] = v0[i].LSB ? vs1[i] : vs2[i]
vmerge.vxm vd, vs2, rs1, v0  # vd[i] = v0[i].LSB ? x[rs1] : vs2[i]
vmerge.vim vd, vs2, imm, v0  # vd[i] = v0[i].LSB ? imm    : vs2[i]
----

=== Vector Integer Move Instructions

The vector integer move instructions copy a source operand to a vector
register group.  These instructions are always unmasked (`vm=1`).
The first operand specifier (`vs2`) must contain `v0`, and any other
vector register number in `vs2` is _reserved_.  This instruction
copies the `vs1`, `rs1`, or immediate operand to the first `vl`
locations of the destination vector register group.

----
vmv.v.v vd, vs1 # vd[i] = vs1[i]
vmv.v.x vd, rs1 # vd[i] = rs1
vmv.v.i vd, imm # vd[i] = imm
----

NOTE: Mask values can be widened into SEW-width elements using a
sequence `vmv.v.i vd, 0; vmerge.vim vd, vd, 1, v0`.

NOTE: The vector integer move instructions share the encoding with the vector
merge instructions, but with `vm=1` and `vs2=v0`.

== Vector Fixed-Point Arithmetic Instructions

A set of vector arithmetic instructions are provided to support
fixed-point arithmetic.

An N-bit element can hold two's-complement signed integers in the
range -2^N-1^...+2^N-1^-1, and unsigned integers in the range 0
... +2^N^-1.  The fixed-point instructions help preserve precision in
narrow operands by supporting scaling and rounding, and can handle
overflow by saturating results into the destination format range.

NOTE: The widening integer operations described above can also be used
to remove the possibility of overflow.

=== Vector Single-Width Saturating Add and Subtract

Saturating forms of integer add and subtract are provided, for both
signed and unsigned integers.  If the result would overflow the
destination, the result is replaced with the closest representable
value, and the `vxsat` bit is set.

----
# Saturating adds of unsigned integers.
vsaddu.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vsaddu.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar
vsaddu.vi vd, vs2, imm, vm   # vector-immediate

# Saturating adds of signed integers.
vsadd.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vsadd.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar
vsadd.vi vd, vs2, imm, vm   # vector-immediate

# Saturating subtract of unsigned integers.
vssubu.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vssubu.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar

# Saturating subtract of signed integers.
vssub.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
vssub.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar
----

=== Vector Single-Width Averaging Add and Subtract

The averaging add and subtract instructions right shift the result by
one bit and round off the result according to the setting in `vxrm`.
Both unsigned and signed versions are provided.
For `vaaddu`, `vaadd`, and `vasub`, there can be no overflow in the result.
For `vasubu`, overflow is ignored.

----
# Averaging add

# Averaging adds of unsigned integers.
vaaddu.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # roundoff_unsigned(vs2[i] + vs1[i], 1)
vaaddu.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # roundoff_unsigned(vs2[i] + x[rs1], 1)

# Averaging adds of signed integers.
vaadd.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # roundoff_signed(vs2[i] + vs1[i], 1)
vaadd.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # roundoff_signed(vs2[i] + x[rs1], 1)

# Averaging subtract

# Averaging subtract of unsigned integers.
vasubu.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # roundoff_unsigned(vs2[i] - vs1[i], 1)
vasubu.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # roundoff_unsigned(vs2[i] - x[rs1], 1)

# Averaging subtract of signed integers.
vasub.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # roundoff_signed(vs2[i] - vs1[i], 1)
vasub.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # roundoff_signed(vs2[i] - x[rs1], 1)
----

=== Vector Single-Width Fractional Multiply with Rounding and Saturation

The signed fractional multiply instruction produces a 2*SEW product of
the two SEW inputs, then shifts the result right by SEW-1 bits,
rounding these bits according to `vxrm`, then saturates the result to
fit into SEW bits.  If the result causes saturation, the `vxsat` bit
is set.

----
# Signed saturating and rounding fractional multiply
# See vxrm  description for rounding calculation
vsmul.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # vd[i] = clip(roundoff_signed(vs2[i]*vs1[i], SEW-1))
vsmul.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vd[i] = clip(roundoff_signed(vs2[i]*x[rs1], SEW-1))
----

NOTE: When multiplying two N-bit signed numbers, the largest magnitude
is obtained for -2^N-1^ * -2^N-1^ producing a result +2^2N-2^, which
has a single (zero) sign bit when held in 2N bits.  All other products
have two sign bits in 2N bits.  To retain greater precision in N
result bits, the product is shifted right by one bit less than N,
saturating the largest magnitude result but increasing result
precision by one bit for all other products.

=== Vector Single-Width Scaling Shift Instructions

These instructions shift the input value right, and round off the
shifted out bits according to `vxrm`.  The scaling right shifts have
both zero-extending (`vssrl`) and sign-extending (`vssra`) forms. The
low lg2(SEW) bits of the vector or scalar shift amount value are used.
The immediate form supports shift amounts up to 31 only.

----
 # Scaling shift right logical
 vssrl.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # vd[i] = roundoff_unsigned(vs2[i], vs1[i])
 vssrl.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vd[i] = roundoff_unsigned(vs2[i], x[rs1])
 vssrl.vi vd, vs2, uimm, vm   # vd[i] = roundoff_unsigned(vs2[i], uimm)

 # Scaling shift right arithmetic
 vssra.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # vd[i] = roundoff_signed(vs2[i],vs1[i])
 vssra.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vd[i] = roundoff_signed(vs2[i], x[rs1])
 vssra.vi vd, vs2, uimm, vm   # vd[i] = roundoff_signed(vs2[i], uimm)
----

=== Vector Narrowing Fixed-Point Clip Instructions

The `vnclip` instructions are used to pack a fixed-point value into a
narrower destination.  The instructions support rounding, scaling, and
saturation into the final destination format.

The second argument (vector element, scalar value, immediate value)
gives the amount to right shift the source as in the narrowing shift
instructions, which provides the scaling.  The low lg2(2*SEW) bits of
the vector or scalar shift amount value are used (e.g., the low 6 bits
for a SEW=64-bit to SEW=32-bit narrowing operation).  The immediate
form supports shift amounts up to 31 only.

----
# Narrowing unsigned clip
#                                SEW                            2*SEW   SEW
 vnclipu.wv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # vd[i] = clip(roundoff_unsigned(vs2[i], vs1[i]))
 vnclipu.wx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vd[i] = clip(roundoff_unsigned(vs2[i], x[rs1]))
 vnclipu.wi vd, vs2, uimm, vm  # vd[i] = clip(roundoff_unsigned(vs2[i], uimm5))

# Narrowing signed clip
 vnclip.wv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # vd[i] = clip(roundoff_signed(vs2[i], vs1[i]))
 vnclip.wx vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vd[i] = clip(roundoff_signed(vs2[i], x[rs1]))
 vnclip.wi vd, vs2, uimm, vm  # vd[i] = clip(roundoff_signed(vs2[i], uimm5))
----

For `vnclipu`/`vnclip`, the rounding mode is specified in the `vxrm`
CSR.  Rounding occurs around the least-significant bit of the
destination and before saturation.

For `vnclipu`, the shifted rounded source value is treated as an
unsigned integer and saturates if the result would overflow the
destination viewed as an unsigned integer.

For `vnclip`, the shifted rounded source value is treated as a signed
integer and saturates if the result would overflow the destination viewed
as a signed integer.

If any destination element is saturated, the `vxsat` bit is set in the
`vxsat` register.

== Vector Floating-Point Instructions

The standard vector floating-point instructions treat 16-bit, 32-bit,
64-bit, and 128-bit elements as IEEE-754/2008-compatible values.  If
the current SEW does not correspond to a supported IEEE floating-point
type, an illegal instruction exception is raised.

NOTE: The floating-point element widths that are supported depend on
the platform.

NOTE: Platforms supporting 16-bit half-precision floating-point values
will also have to implement scalar half-precision floating-point
support in the `f` registers.

The vector floating-point instructions have the same behavior as the
scalar floating-point instructions with regard to NaNs.

Scalar values for vector-scalar operations can be sourced from the
standard scalar `f` registers.

NOTE: Scalar floating-point values will be sourced from the integer
`x` registers in the proposed Zfinx variant.

=== Vector Floating-Point Exception Flags

A vector floating-point exception at any active floating-point element
sets the standard FP exception flags in the `fflags` register.  Inactive
elements do not set FP exception flags.

=== Vector Single-Width Floating-Point Fused Multiply-Add Instructions

All four varieties of fused multiply-add are provided, and in two
destructive forms that overwrite one of the operands, either the
addend or the first multiplicand.

----

NOTE: It would be possible to use the two unused rounding modes in the
scalar FP FMA encoding to provide a few non-destructive FMAs.
However, this would be the only maskable operation with three inputs
and separate output.

=== Vector Widening Floating-Point Fused Multiply-Add Instructions

=== Vector Floating-Point MIN/MAX Instructions

The vector floating-point `vfmin` and `vfmax` instructions have the
same behavior as the corresponding scalar floating-point instructions
in version 2.2 of the RISC-V F/D/Q extension.

----
    # Floating-point minimum
    vfmin.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
    vfmin.vf vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar

    # Floating-point maximum
    vfmax.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
    vfmax.vf vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar
----

=== Vector Floating-Point Sign-Injection Instructions

Vector versions of the scalar sign-injection instructions.  The result
takes all bits except the sign bit from the vector `vs2` operands.

----
    vfsgnj.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
    vfsgnj.vf vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar

    vfsgnjn.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
    vfsgnjn.vf vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar

    vfsgnjx.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector
    vfsgnjx.vf vd, vs2, rs1, vm   # vector-scalar

=== Vector Floating-Point Compare Instructions

These vector FP compare instructions compare two source operands and
write the comparison result to a mask register.  The destination mask
vector is always held in a single vector register, with a layout of
elements as described in Section <<sec-mask-register-layout>>.

The compare instructions follow the semantics of the scalar
floating-point compare instructions.  `vmfeq` and `vmfne` raise the invalid
operation exception only on signaling NaN inputs.  `vmflt`, `vmfle`, `vmfgt`,
and `vmfge` raise the invalid operation exception on both signaling and
quiet NaN inputs.
`vmfne` writes 1 to the destination element when either
operand is NaN, whereas the other comparisons write 0 when either operand
is NaN.

For all comparison instructions, an illegal instruction exception is raised if
the destination vector register overlaps a source vector register group and
LMUL > 1.

----
    # Compare equal
    vmfeq.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # Vector-vector
    vmfeq.vf vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vector-scalar

    # Compare not equal
    vmfne.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # Vector-vector
    vmfne.vf vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vector-scalar

    # Compare less than
    vmflt.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # Vector-vector
    vmflt.vf vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vector-scalar

    # Compare less than or equal
    vmfle.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # Vector-vector
    vmfle.vf vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vector-scalar

    # Compare greater than
    vmfgt.vf vd, vs2, rs1, vm  # vector-scalar

    # Compare greater than or equal

----

NOTE: Providing all forms is necessary to correctly handle unordered
comparisons for NaNs.

NOTE: C99 floating-point quiet comparisons can be implemented by masking
the signaling comparisons when either input is NaN, as follows.  When
the comparand is a non-NaN constant, the middle two instructions can be
omitted.

----
    # Example of implementing isgreater()
    vmfeq.vv v0, va, va        # Only set where A is not NaN.
    vmfeq.vv v1, vb, vb        # Only set where B is not NaN.
    vmand.mm v0, v0, v1        # Only set where A and B are ordered,
    vmfgt.vv v0, va, vb, v0.t  #  so only set flags on ordered values.
----

NOTE: In the above sequence, it is tempting to mask the second `vmfeq`
instruction and remove the `vmand` instruction, but this more efficient
sequence incorrectly fails to raise the invalid exception when an
element of `va` contains a quiet NaN and the corresponding element in
`vb` contains a signaling NaN.

=== Vector Floating-Point Classify Instruction

This is a unary vector-vector instruction that operates in the same
way as the scalar classify instruction.

----
    vfclass.v vd, vs2, vm   # Vector-vector
----

The 10-bit mask produced by this instruction is placed in the
least-significant bits of the result elements.  The instruction is
only defined for SEW=16b and above, so the result will always fit in
the destination elements.

=== Vector Floating-Point Merge Instruction

A vector-scalar floating-point merge instruction is provided, which
operates on all body elements, from `vstart` up to the current vector
length in `vl` regardless of mask value.

The `vfmerge.vfm` instruction is always masked (`vm=0`).
At elements where the mask value is zero, the first vector operand is
copied to the destination element, otherwise a scalar floating-point
register value is copied to the destination element.

----
vfmerge.vfm vd, vs2, rs1, v0  # vd[i] = v0[i].LSB ? f[rs1] : vs2[i]
----

NOTE: Like the floating-point computational instructions, when FLEN > SEW,
`vfmerge.vfm` substitutes a canonical NaN for `f[rs1]` if the latter is not
properly NaN-boxed.

=== Vector Floating-Point Move Instruction

The vector floating-point move instruction __splats__ a floating-point scalar
operand to a vector register group.  The instruction copies a scalar `f`
register value to all active elements of a vector register group.  This
instruction is always unmasked (`vm=1`).  The instruction must have the `vs2`
field set to `v0`, with all other values for `vs2` reserved.

----
vfmv.v.f vd, rs1  # vd[i] = f[rs1]
----

NOTE: The `vfmv.v.f` instruction shares the encoding with the `vfmerge.vfm`
instruction, but with `vm=1` and `vs2=v0`.

NOTE: Like the floating-point computational instructions, when FLEN > SEW,
`vfmv.v.f` substitutes a canonical NaN for `f[rs1]` if the latter is not
properly NaN-boxed.

=== Single-Width Floating-Point/Integer Type-Convert Instructions

Conversion operations are provided to convert to and from
floating-point values and unsigned and signed integers, where both
source and destination are SEW wide.

----
vfcvt.xu.f.v vd, vs2, vm   # Convert float to unsigned integer.
vfcvt.x.f.v  vd, vs2, vm   # Convert float to signed integer.

vfcvt.f.xu.v vd, vs2, vm   # Convert unsigned integer to float.
vfcvt.f.x.v  vd, vs2, vm   # Convert signed integer to float.
----

The conversions follow the same rules on exceptional conditions as the
scalar conversion instructions.  The conversions always use the
dynamic rounding mode in `frm`.

=== Widening Floating-Point/Integer Type-Convert Instructions

A set of conversion instructions are provided to convert between
narrower integer and floating-point datatypes to a type of twice the
width.

----
vfwcvt.xu.f.v vd, vs2, vm   # Convert float to double-width unsigned integer.
vfwcvt.x.f.v  vd, vs2, vm   # Convert float to double-width signed integer.

vfwcvt.f.xu.v vd, vs2, vm   # Convert unsigned integer to double-width float.
vfwcvt.f.x.v  vd, vs2, vm   # Convert signed integer to double-width float.

vfwcvt.f.f.v vd, vs2, vm   # Convert single-width float to double-width float.
----

These instructions have the same constraints on vector register overlap
as other widening instructions (see <<sec-widening>>).

NOTE: A double-width IEEE floating-point value can always represent a
single-width integer exactly.

NOTE: A double-width IEEE floating-point value can always represent a
single-width IEEE floating-point value exactly.

NOTE: A full set of floating-point widening conversions are not
supported as single instructions, but any widening conversion can be
implemented as several doubling steps with equivalent results and no
additional exception flags raised.

=== Narrowing Floating-Point/Integer Type-Convert Instructions

A set of conversion instructions are provided to convert wider integer
and floating-point datatypes to a type of half the width.

----
vfncvt.xu.f.w vd, vs2, vm   # Convert double-width float to unsigned integer.
vfncvt.x.f.w  vd, vs2, vm   # Convert double-width float to signed integer.

vfncvt.f.xu.w vd, vs2, vm   # Convert double-width unsigned integer to float.
vfncvt.f.x.w  vd, vs2, vm   # Convert double-width signed integer to float.

vfncvt.f.f.w vd, vs2, vm    # Convert double-width float to single-width float.
vfncvt.rod.f.f.w vd, vs2, vm  # Convert double-width float to single-width float,
                              #  rounding towards odd.
----

These instructions have the same constraints on vector register overlap
as other narrowing instructions (see <<sec-narrowing>>).

NOTE: A full set of floating-point widening conversions are not
supported as single instructions. Conversions can be implemented in
a sequence of halving steps.  Results are equivalently rounded and
the same exception flags are raised if all but the last halving step
use round-towards-odd (`vfncvt.rod.f.f.w`).  Only the final step
should use the desired rounding mode.

NOTE: An integer value can be halved in width using the narrowing
integer shift instructions with a shift amount of 0.

== Vector Reduction Operations

Vector reduction operations take a vector register group of elements
and a scalar held in element 0 of a vector register, and perform a
reduction using some binary operator, to produce a scalar result in
element 0 of a vector register.  The scalar input and output operands
are held in element 0 of a single vector register, not a vector
register group, so any vector register can be the scalar source or
destination of a vector reduction regardless of LMUL setting.

NOTE: Reductions read and write the scalar operand and result into
element 0 of a vector register to avoid a loss of decoupling with the
scalar processor, and to support future polymorphic use with future
types not supported in the scalar unit.

Inactive elements from the source vector register group are excluded
from the reduction, but the scalar operand is always included
regardless of mask.

The other elements in the destination vector register ( 0 < index <
VLEN/SEW) are left unchanged.

If `vl`=0, no operation is performed and the destination register is
not updated.

Traps on vector reduction instructions are always reported with a
`vstart` of 0.  Vector reduction operations raise an illegal
instruction exception if `vstart` is non-zero.

The assembler syntax for a reduction operation is `vredop.vs`, where
the `.vs` suffix denotes the first operand is a vector register group
and the second operand is a scalar stored in element 0 of a vector
register.

=== Vector Single-Width Integer Reduction Instructions

All operands and results of single-width reduction instructions have
the same SEW width.  Overflows wrap around on arithmetic sums.

----
    # Simple reductions, where [*] denotes all active elements:
    vredsum.vs  vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # vd[0] =  sum( vs1[0] , vs2[*] )
    vredmaxu.vs vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # vd[0] = maxu( vs1[0] , vs2[*] )
    vredmax.vs  vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # vd[0] =  max( vs1[0] , vs2[*] )
    vredminu.vs vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # vd[0] = minu( vs1[0] , vs2[*] )
    vredmin.vs  vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # vd[0] =  min( vs1[0] , vs2[*] )
    vredand.vs  vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # vd[0] =  and( vs1[0] , vs2[*] )
    vredor.vs   vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # vd[0] =   or( vs1[0] , vs2[*] )
    vredxor.vs  vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # vd[0] =  xor( vs1[0] , vs2[*] )
----

=== Vector Widening Integer Reduction Instructions

The unsigned `vwredsumu.vs` instruction zero-extends the SEW-wide
vector elements before summing them, then adds the 2*SEW-width scalar
element, and stores the result in a 2*SEW-width scalar element.

The `vwredsum.vs` instruction sign-extends the SEW-wide vector
elements before summing them.

----
    # Unsigned sum reduction into double-width accumulator
    vwredsumu.vs vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # 2*SEW = 2*SEW + sum(zero-extend(SEW)) 

    # Signed sum reduction into double-width accumulator
    vwredsum.vs  vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # 2*SEW = 2*SEW + sum(sign-extend(SEW))
----

=== Vector Single-Width Floating-Point Reduction Instructions

----
    # Simple reductions.
    vfredosum.vs vd, vs2, vs1, vm # Ordered sum
    vfredsum.vs  vd, vs2, vs1, vm # Unordered sum
    vfredmax.vs  vd, vs2, vs1, vm # Maximum value
    vfredmin.vs  vd, vs2, vs1, vm # Minimum value

----

==== Vector Ordered Single-Width Floating-Point Sum Reduction

The `vfredosum` instruction must sum the floating-point values in
element order, starting with the scalar in `vs1[0]`--that is, it
performs the computation: `(((vs1[0] + vs2[0]) + vs2[1]) + ...) +
vs2[vl-1]`, where each addition operates identically to the scalar
floating-point instructions in terms of raising exception flags and
generating or propagating special values.

NOTE: The ordered reduction supports compiler autovectorization, while
the unordered FP sum allows for faster implementations.

When the operation is masked (`vm=0`), the masked-off elements do not
affect the result or the exception flags.

NOTE: If no elements are active, no additions are performed, so the scalar in
`vs1[0]` is simply copied to the destination register, without canonicalizing
NaN values and without setting any exception flags.  This behavior preserves
the handling of NaNs, exceptions, and rounding when autovectorizing a scalar
summation loop.

==== Vector Unordered Single-Width Floating-Point Sum Reduction

The unordered sum reduction instruction, `vfredsum`, provides an
implementation more freedom in performing the reduction.

The implementation can produce a result equivalent to a reduction tree
composed of binary operator nodes, with the inputs being elements from
the source vector register group (`vs2`) and the source scalar value
(`vs1[0]`).  Each operator in the tree accepts two inputs and produces
one result.  Each operator can either perform an exact addition, or a
floating-point addition according to the RISC-V IEEE scalar
floating-point specification and with the currently active
floating-point dynamic rounding mode.
A node where one input is derived only from elements masked-off or beyond the
active vector length may either treat that input as IEEE +0.0 of the
appropriate SEW or simply copy the other input to its output.  The root node in
the tree must produce an IEEE result of the appropriate SEW.  An implementation
is allowed to add an additional IEEE +0.0 to the final result.

The reduction tree structure must be deterministic for a given value
in `vtype` and `vl`.

NOTE: As a consequence of this definition, implementations need not propagate
NaN payloads through the reduction tree when no elements are active. In
particular, if no elements are active and the scalar input is NaN,
implementations are permitted to canonicalize the NaN and, if the NaN is
signaling, set the invalid exception flag.  Implementations are alternatively
permitted to pass through the original NaN and set no exception flags, as with
`vfredosum`.

NOTE: The `vfredosum` instruction is a valid implementation of the
`vfredsum` instruction.

==== Vector Single-Width Floating Max and Min Reductions

NOTE: Floating-point max and min reductions should return the same
final value and raise the same exception flags regardless of operation
order.

=== Vector Widening Floating-Point Reduction Instructions

Widening forms of the sum reductions are provided that
read and write a double-width reduction result.

----
 # Simple reductions.
 vfwredosum.vs vd, vs2, vs1, vm # Ordered sum
 vfwredsum.vs vd, vs2, vs1, vm  # Unordered sum
----

The reduction of the SEW-width elements is performed as in the
single-width reduction case, with the elements in `vs2` promoted
to 2*SEW bits before adding to the 2*SEW-bit accumulator.

== Vector Mask Instructions

Several instructions are provided to help operate on mask values held in
a vector register.

[[sec-mask-register-logical]]
=== Vector Mask-Register Logical Instructions

Vector mask-register logical operations operate on mask registers.
The size of one element in a mask register is SEW/LMUL, so these
instructions all operate on single vector registers regardless of the
setting of the `vlmul` field in `vtype`.  They do not change the value
of `vlmul`.

As with other vector instructions, the elements with indices less than
`vstart` are unchanged, and `vstart` is reset to zero after execution.
Vector mask logical instructions are always unmasked so there are no
inactive elements.  Mask elements past `vl`, the tail elements, are
unchanged.

Within a mask element, these instructions perform their operations
using only the least-significant bit of each operand and zero-extend
the single-bit result to fill the destination mask element.

----
    vmand.mm vd, vs2, vs1     # vd[i] =   vs2[i].LSB &&  vs1[i].LSB
    vmnand.mm vd, vs2, vs1    # vd[i] = !(vs2[i].LSB &&  vs1[i].LSB)
    vmandnot.mm vd, vs2, vs1  # vd[i] =   vs2[i].LSB && !vs1[i].LSB
    vmxor.mm  vd, vs2, vs1    # vd[i] =   vs2[i].LSB ^^  vs1[i].LSB
    vmor.mm  vd, vs2, vs1     # vd[i] =   vs2[i].LSB ||  vs1[i].LSB
    vmnor.mm  vd, vs2, vs1    # vd[i] = !(vs2[i[.LSB ||  vs1[i].LSB)
    vmornot.mm  vd, vs2, vs1  # vd[i] =   vs2[i].LSB || !vs1[i].LSB
    vmxnor.mm vd, vs2, vs1    # vd[i] = !(vs2[i].LSB ^^  vs1[i].LSB)
----

Several assembler pseudoinstructions are defined as shorthand for
common uses of mask logical operations:
----
    vmcpy.m vd, vs  => vmand.mm vd, vs, vs  # Copy mask register
    vmclr.m vd     => vmxor.mm vd, vd, vd   # Clear mask register
    vmset.m vd     => vmxnor.mm vd, vd, vd  # Set mask register
    vmnot.m vd, vs => vmnand.mm vd, vs, vs  # Invert bits
----

NOTE: The vmcpy.m instruction is not called vmmv as elsewhere in the
architecture mv implies a bitwise copy without interpreting the bits.
The vmcpy.m instruction will clear upper bits of the destination mask
register to zero regardless of source values in these bits.

The set of eight mask logical instructions can generate any of the 16
possibly binary logical functions of the two input masks:

| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | vmxnor.mm vd, vd, vd        | vmset.m vd
|===

NOTE: The vector mask logical instructions are designed to be easily
fused with a following masked vector operation to effectively expand
the number of predicate registers by moving values into `v0` before
use.

=== Vector mask population count `vpopc`

----
    vpopc.m rd, vs2, vm
----

The source operand is a single vector register holding mask register
values as described in Section <<sec-mask-register-layout>>.

The `vpopc.m` instruction counts the number of mask elements of the
active elements of the vector source mask register that have their
least-significant bit set, and writes the result to a scalar `x`
register.

The operation can be performed under a mask, in which case only the
masked elements are counted.

----
 vpopc.m rd, vs2, v0.t # x[rd] = sum_i ( vs2[i].LSB && v0[i].LSB )
----

Traps on `vpopc.m` are always reported with a `vstart` of 0.  The
`vpopc` instruction will raise an illegal instruction exception if
`vstart` is non-zero.

=== `vfirst` find-first-set mask bit

----
    vfirst.m rd, vs2, vm
----

The `vfirst` instruction finds the lowest-numbered active element of
the source mask vector that has its LSB set and writes that element's
index to a GPR.  If no element has an LSB set, -1 is written to the
GPR.

NOTE: Software can assume that any negative value (highest bit set)
corresponds to no element found, as vector lengths will never exceed
2^(XLEN-1)^ on any implementation.

Traps on `vfirst` are always reported with a `vstart` of 0.  The
`vfirst` instruction will raise an illegal instruction exception if
`vstart` is non-zero.

=== `vmsbf.m` set-before-first mask bit

----
    vmsbf.m vd, vs2, vm

 # Example

     7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0   Element number

     1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0   v3 contents
                       vmsbf.m v2, v3
     0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1   v2 contents

     1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1   v3 contents

                       vmsbf.m v2, v3, v0.t
     0 1 x x x x 1 1   v2 contents
----

The `vmsbf.m` instruction takes a mask register as input and writes
results to a mask register.  The instruction writes a 1 to all active
mask elements before the first source element that has a set LSB, then
writes a zero to that element and all following active elements.  If
there is no set bit in the source vector, then all active elements in
the destination are written with a 1.

The tail elements in the destination mask register are unchanged.

Traps on `vmsbf.m` are always reported with a `vstart` of 0.  The
`vmsbf` instruction will raise an illegal instruction exception if
`vstart` is non-zero.

=== `vmsif.m` set-including-first mask bit

The vector mask set-including-first instruction is similar to
set-before-first, except it also includes the element with a set bit.

----
    vmsif.m vd, vs2, vm

 # Example

     7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0   Element number

     1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0   v3 contents
                       vmsif.m v2, v3
     0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1   v2 contents

     1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1   v3 contents
                       vmsif.m v2, v3
     0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1   v2

     1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1   v0 vcontents
     1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0   v3 contents
                       vmsif.m v2, v3, v0.t
     1 1 x x x x 1 1   v2 contents
----

The tail elements in the destination mask register are unchanged.

Traps on `vmsif.m` are always reported with a `vstart` of 0.  The
`vmsif` instruction will raise an illegal instruction exception if
`vstart` is non-zero.

=== `vmsof.m` set-only-first mask bit

The vector mask set-only-first instruction is similar to
set-before-first, except it only sets the first element with a bit
set, if any.

----
    vmsof.m vd, vs2, vm

 # Example

     7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0   Element number

     1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1   v0 vcontents
     1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0   v3 contents
                       vmsof.m v2, v3, v0.t
     0 1 x x x x 0 0   v2 contents
----

The tail elements in the destination mask register are unchanged.

Traps on `vmsof.m` are always reported with a `vstart` of 0.  The
`vmsof` instruction will raise an illegal instruction exception if
`vstart` is non-zero.

=== Example using vector mask instructions

The following is an example of vectorizing a data-dependent exit loop.

----
  # char* strcpy(char *dst, const char* src)
strcpy:
      mv a2, a0             # Copy dst
      li t0, -1             # Infinite AVL
loop:
    vsetvli x0, t0, e8      # Max length vectors of bytes
    vlbuff.v v1, (a1)       # Get src bytes
      csrr t1, vl           # Get number of bytes fetched
    vmseq.vi v0, v1, 0      # Flag zero bytes
    vfirst.m a3, v0         # Zero found?
      add a1, a1, t1        # Bump pointer
    vmsif.m v0, v0          # Set mask up to and including zero byte.
    vsb.v v1, (a2), v0.t    # Write out bytes
      add a2, a2, t1        # Bump pointer
      bltz a3, loop         # Zero byte not found, so loop

      ret

  # char* strncpy(char *dst, const char* src, size_t n)
strncpy:
      mv a3, a0             # Copy dst
loop:
    vsetvli x0, a2, e8   # Vectors of bytes.
    vlbuff.v v1, (a1)       # Get src bytes
    vmseq.vi v0, v1, 0      # Flag zero bytes
    vfirst.m a4, v0         # Zero found?
    vmsif.m v0, v0          # Set mask up to and including zero byte.
    vsb.v v1, (a3), v0.t    # Write out bytes
      csrr t1, vl           # Get number of bytes fetched
      sub a2, a2, t1        # Decrement count.
      bgez a4, zero_tail    # Zero remaining bytes.
      add a1, a1, t1        # Bump pointer
      add a3, a3, t1        # Bump pointer
      bnez a2, loop         # Anymore?

      ret

zero_tail:
    vsetvli x0, a2, e8,m8   # Vectors of bytes.
    vmv.v.i v0, 0           # Splat zero.

zero_loop:
    vsetvli t1, a2, e8,m8   # Vectors of bytes.
    vsb.v v0, (a3)          # Store zero.
      sub a2, a2, t1        # Decrement count.
      add a3, a3, t1        # Bump pointer
      bnez a2, zero_loop    # Anymore?

      ret

----

=== Vector Iota Instruction

The `viota.m` instruction reads a source vector mask register and
writes to each element of the destination vector register group the
sum of all the least-significant bits of elements in the mask register
whose index is less than the element, e.g., a parallel prefix sum of
the mask values.

This instruction can be masked, in which case only the enabled
elements contribute to the sum and only the enabled elements are
written.

----
 viota.m vd, vs2, vm

 # Example

     7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0   Element number

     1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1   v2 contents
                       viota.m v4, v2 # Unmasked
     2 2 2 1 1 1 1 0   v4 result

     1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1   v0 contents
     1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1   v2 contents
     2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   v4 contents
                       viota.m v4, v2, v0.t # Masked
     1 1 1 5 1 7 1 0   v4 results
----

The result value is zero-extended to fill the destination element if
SEW is wider than the result.  If the result value would overflow the
destination SEW, the least-significant SEW bits are retained.

Traps on `viota.m` are always reported with a `vstart` of 0, and
execution is always restarted from the beginning when resuming after a
trap handler.  An illegal instruction exception is raised if `vstart`
is non-zero.

An illegal instruction exception is raised if the destination vector
register group overlaps the source vector mask register.  If the
instruction is masked, an illegal instruction exception is issued if
the destination vector register group overlaps `v0`.

NOTE: These constraints exist for two reasons.  First, to simplify
avoidance of WAR hazards in implementations with temporally long vector
registers and no vector register renaming.  Second, to enable resuming
execution after a trap simpler.

The `viota.m` instruction can be combined with memory scatter
instructions (indexed stores) to perform vector compress functions.

----

----

=== Vector Element Index Instruction

The `vid.v` instruction writes each element's index to the
destination vector register group, from 0 to `vl`-1.

----
    vid.v vd, vm  # Write element ID to destination.
----

The instruction can be masked.

The `vs2` field of the instruction must be set to `v0`, otherwise the
encoding is _reserved_.

The result value is zero-extended to fill the destination element if
SEW is wider than the result.  If the result value would overflow the
destination SEW, the least-significant SEW bits are retained.

NOTE: This constraint is to avoid WAR hazards in long vector
implementations without register renaming, and to support restart.

NOTE: Microarchitectures can implement `vid.v` instruction using the
same datapath as `viota.m` but with an implicit set mask source.

== Vector Permutation Instructions

A range of permutation instructions are provided to move elements
around within the vector registers.

=== Integer Scalar Move Instructions

The integer scalar read/write instructions transfer a single
value between a scalar `x` register and element 0 of a vector
register.  The instructions ignore LMUL and vector register groups.

----
vmv.x.s rd, vs2  # x[rd] = vs2[0] (rs1=0)
vmv.s.x vd, rs1  # vd[0] = x[rs1] (vs2=0)
----

The `vmv.x.s` instruction copies a single SEW-wide element from index 0 of the
source vector register to a destination integer register.  If SEW > XLEN, the
least-significant XLEN bits are transferred and the upper SEW-XLEN bits are
ignored.  If SEW < XLEN, the value is sign-extended to XLEN bits.

The `vmv.s.x` instruction copies the scalar integer register to element 0 of
the destination vector register.  If SEW < XLEN, the least-significant bits
are copied and the upper XLEN-SEW bits are ignored.  If SEW > XLEN, the value
is sign-extended to SEW bits.  The other elements in the destination vector
register ( 0 < index < VLEN/SEW) are unchanged.  If `vstart` {ge} `vl`, no
operation is performed and the destination register is not updated.

NOTE: As a consequence, when `vl`=0, no elements are updated in the
destination vector register group, regardless of `vstart`.

The encodings corresponding to the masked versions (`vm=0`) of `vmv.x.s`
and `vmv.s.x` are reserved.

=== Floating-Point Scalar Move Instructions

The floating-point scalar read/write instructions transfer a single
value between a scalar `f` register and element 0 of a vector
register.  The instructions ignore LMUL and vector register groups.

----
vfmv.f.s rd, vs2  # f[rd] = vs2[0] (rs1=0)
vfmv.s.f vd, rs1  # vd[0] = f[rs1] (vs2=0)
----

The `vfmv.f.s` instruction copies a single SEW-wide element from index
0 of the source vector register to a destination scalar floating-point
register.  If SEW > FLEN, the least-significant FLEN bits are
transferred and the upper SEW-FLEN bits are ignored.  If SEW < FLEN,
the value is NaN-boxed (1-extended) to FLEN bits.

The `vfmv.s.f` instruction copies the scalar floating-point register
to element 0 of the destination vector register.  If SEW < FLEN, the
least-significant bits are copied and the upper FLEN-SEW bits are
ignored.  If SEW > FLEN, the value is NaN-boxed (1-extended) to SEW
bits.  The other elements in the destination vector register ( 0 <
index < VLEN/SEW) are unchanged.  If `vstart` {ge} `vl`, no operation
is performed and the destination register is not updated.

NOTE: As a consequence, when `vl`=0, no elements are updated in the
destination vector register group, regardless of `vstart`.

The encodings corresponding to the masked versions (`vm=0`) of `vfmv.f.s`
and `vfmv.s.f` are reserved.

=== Vector Slide Instructions

The slide instructions move elements up and down a vector register
group.

NOTE: The slide operations can be implemented much more efficiently
than using the arbitrary register gather instruction.  Implementations
may optimize certain OFFSET values for `vslideup` and `vslidedown`.
In particular, power-of-2 offsets may operate substantially faster
than other offsets.

For all of the `vslideup`, `vslidedown`, `vslide1up`, and
`vslide1down` instructions, if `vstart` {ge} `vl`, the instruction performs no
operation and leaves the destination vector register unchanged.

NOTE: As a consequence, when `vl`=0, no elements are updated in the
destination vector register group, regardless of `vstart`.

The slide instructions may be masked, with mask element _i_ controlling whether
_destination_ element _i_ is written.

==== Vector Slideup Instructions

----
 vslideup.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm        # vd[i+rs1] = vs2[i]
 vslideup.vi vd, vs2, uimm[4:0], vm  # vd[i+uimm] = vs2[i]
----

For `vslideup`, the value in `vl` specifies the maximum number of destination
elements that are written.  The start index (_OFFSET_) for the
destination can be either specified using an unsigned integer in the
`x` register specified by `rs1`, or a 5-bit immediate treated as an
unsigned 5-bit quantity.
If XLEN > SEW, _OFFSET_ is _not_ truncated to SEW bits.
Destination elements _OFFSET_ through `vl`-1 are written if unmasked and
if _OFFSET_ < `vl`.

----
   vslideup behavior for destination elements

   OFFSET is amount to slideup, either from x register or a 5-bit immediate

                    0 <  i < max(vstart, OFFSET)  Unchanged
  max(vstart, OFFSET) <= i < vl                   vd[i] = vs2[i-OFFSET] if mask enabled,
                                                   unchanged if not
                   vl <= i < VLMAX                Tail elements, unchanged
----

The destination vector register group for `vslideup` cannot overlap
the vector register group of the source vector register group or the
mask register, otherwise an illegal instruction exception is raised.

NOTE: The non-overlap constraint avoids WAR hazards on the
input vectors during execution, and enables restart with non-zero
`vstart`.

==== Vector Slidedown Instructions

----
 vslidedown.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm       # vd[i] = vs2[i+rs1]
 vslidedown.vi vd, vs2, uimm[4:0], vm # vd[i] = vs2[i+uimm]
----

For `vslidedown`, the value in `vl` specifies the number of
destination elements that are written.

The start index (_OFFSET_) for the source can be either specified
using an unsigned integer in the `x` register specified by `rs1`, or a
5-bit immediate treated as an unsigned 5-bit quantity.
If XLEN > SEW, _OFFSET_ is _not_ truncated to SEW bits.

----
    vslidedown behavior for source elements for element i in slide
                     0 <= i+OFFSET < VLMAX   Read vs2[i+OFFSET]
                 VLMAX <= i+OFFSET           Read as 0

    vslidedown behavior for destination element i in slide
                     0 <  i < vstart         Unchanged
                vstart <= i < vl             Updated if mask enabled, unchanged if not
                    vl <= i < VLMAX          Unchanged

----

The destination vector register group cannot overlap the mask register
if LMUL>1, otherwise an illegal instruction exception is raised.

==== Vector Slide1up

Variants of slide are provided that only move by one element but which
also allow a scalar integer value to be inserted at the vacated
element position.

----
 vslide1up.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm        # vd[0]=x[rs1], vd[i+1] = vs2[i]
----

The `vslide1up` instruction places the `x` register argument at
location 0 of the destination vector register group, provided that
element 0 is active, otherwise the destination element is unchanged.
If XLEN < SEW, the value is sign-extended to SEW bits.  If XLEN > SEW,
the least-significant bits are copied over and the high SEW-XLEN bits
are ignored.

The remaining active `vl`-1 elements are copied over from index _i_ in
the source vector register group to index _i_+1 in the destination
vector register group.

The `vl` register specifies how many of the destination vector
register elements are written with source values, and all tail
elements are unchanged.


----
   vslide1up behavior

                    i < vstart  unchanged
                0 = i = vstart  vd[i] = x[rs1] if mask enabled, unchanged if not
  max(vstart, 1) <= i < vl      vd[i] = vs2[i-1] if mask enabled, unchanged if not
              vl <= i < VLMAX   unchanged
----

The `vslide1up` instruction requires that the destination vector
register group does not overlap the source vector register group or
the mask register.  Otherwise, an illegal instruction exception is
raised.

==== Vector Slide1down Instruction

The `vslide1down` instruction copies the first `vl`-1 active elements
values from index _i_+1 in the source vector register group to index
_i_ in the destination vector register group.

The `vl` register specifies how many of the destination vector
register elements are written with source values, and all tail
elements are unchanged.

----
 vslide1down.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm      # vd[i] = vs2[i+1], vd[vl-1]=x[rs1]
----

The `vslide1down` instruction places the `x` register argument at
location `vl`-1 in the destination vector register, provided that
element `vl-1` is active, otherwise the destination element is
unchanged. If XLEN < SEW, the value is sign-extended to SEW bits.  If
XLEN > SEW, the least-significant bits are copied over and the high
SEW-XLEN bits are ignored.

----
   vslide1down behavior

                       i < vstart  unchanged
             vstart <= i < vl-1    vd[i] = vs2[i+1] if mask enabled, unchanged if not
             vstart <= i = vl-1    vd[vl-1] = x[rs1] if mask enabled, unchanged if not
                 vl <= i < VLMAX   unchanged
----

The destination vector register group cannot overlap the source mask
register if LMUL>1, otherwise an illegal instruction exception is
raised.

NOTE: The `vslide1down` instruction can be used to load values into a
vector register without using memory and without disturbing other
vector registers.  This provides a path for debuggers to modify the
contents of a vector register, albeit slowly, with multiple repeated
`vslide1down` invocations.

=== Vector Register Gather Instruction

The vector register gather instruction reads elements from a first
source vector register group at locations given by a second source
vector register group.  The index values in the second vector are
treated as unsigned integers.  The source vector can be read at any
index < VLMAX regardless of `vl`.  The number of elements to write to
the destination register is given by `vl`, and elements past `vl` in
the destination are unchanged.  The operation can be masked.

----
vrgather.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm # vd[i] = (vs1[i] >= VLMAX) ? 0 : vs2[vs1[i]];
----

If the element indices are out of range ( `vs1[i]` {ge} VLMAX )
then zero is returned for the element value.

Vector-scalar and vector-immediate forms of the register gather are
also provided.  These read one element from the source vector at the
given index, and write this value to the `vl` elements at the start of
the destination vector register. The index value in the scalar register
and the immediate are treated as unsigned integers.
If XLEN > SEW, the index value is _not_ truncated to SEW bits.

NOTE: These forms allow any vector element to be "splatted" to an entire vector.

----
vrgather.vx vd, vs2, rs1, vm # vd[i] = (x[rs1] >= VLMAX) ? 0 : vs2[x[rs1]]
vrgather.vi vd, vs2, uimm, vm # vd[i] = (uimm >= VLMAX) ? 0 : vs2[uimm]
----

For any `vrgather` instruction, the destination vector register group
cannot overlap with the source vector register groups, including the
mask register if the operation is masked, otherwise an illegal
instruction exception is raised.

NOTE: When SEW=8, `vrgather.vv` can only reference vector elements 0-255.

=== Vector Compress Instruction

The vector compress instruction allows elements selected by a vector
mask register from a source vector register group to be packed into
contiguous elements at the start of the destination vector register
group.

----
  vcompress.vm vd, vs2, vs1  # Compress into vd elements of vs2 where vs1 is enabled
----

The vector mask register specified by `vs1` indicates which of the
first `vl` elements of vector register group `vs2` should be extracted
and packed into contiguous elements at the beginning of vector
register `vd`. Any remaining elements of `vd` are unchanged.

----
    Example use of vcompress instruction

        1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1   v0
        8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0   v1
        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   v2
        
                                vcompress.vm v2, v1, v0
        1 2 3 4 8 7 5 2 0   v2
----

`vcompress` is encoded as an unmasked instruction (`vm=1`). The equivalent
masked instruction (`vm=0`) is reserved.

The destination vector register group cannot overlap the source vector
register group or the source vector mask register, otherwise an
illegal instruction exception is raised.

A trap on a `vcompress` instruction is always reported with a
`vstart` of 0.  Executing a `vcompress` instruction with a non-zero
`vstart` raises an illegal instruction exception.

NOTE: Although possible, `vcompress` is one of the more difficult
instructions to restart with a non-zero `vstart`, so assumption is
implementations will choose not do that but will instead restart from
element 0.  This does mean elements in destination register after
`vstart` will already have been updated.

=== Whole Vector Register Move

The `vmv<nf>r.v` instructions copy whole vector registers (i.e., all
VLEN bits) ignoring the current settings of the `vl` and `vtype`
register, and can copy whole vector register groups.

NOTE: These instructions are intended to aid compilers to shuffle
vector registers without needing to know or change `vl` or `vtype`.

The instruction is encoded as an OPIVI instruction.  The number of
vector registers to copy is encoded in the low three bits of the
`simm` field using the same encoding as the `nf` field for memory
instructions. The upper two bits of `simm` field must be zero, with
other encodings reserved.  The value in `nf` must be correspond to 1,
2, 4, or 8 registers.

NOTE: A future extension may support other numbers of registers to be
moved, but currently the values of `nf` corresponding to 3, 5, 6, 7
are reserved.

NOTE: The instruction uses the same funct6 encoding as the `vsmul`
instruction but with an immediate operand, and only the unmasked
version (`vm=1`).  This encoding is chosen as it is close to the
related `vmerge` encoding, and it is unlikely the `vsmul` instruction
would benefit from an immediate form.

----
    vmv<nf>r.v vd, vs2  # General form

    vmv1r.v v1, v2   #  Copy v1=v2
    vmv2r.v v10, v12 #  Copy v10=v12; v11=v13
    vmv4r.v v4, v8   #  Copy v4=v8; v5=v9; v6=v10; v7=v12
    vmv8r.v v0, v8   #  Copy v0=v8; v1=v9; ...;  v7=v15
----

The source and destination vector register numbers must be aligned
appropriately for the vector register group size.

NOTE: A future extension may relax the vector register alignment
restrictions.

NOTE: If `vd` is equal to `vs2` the instruction is a NOP.

== Exception Handling

On a trap during a vector instruction (caused by either a synchronous
exception or an asynchronous interrupt), the existing `*epc` CSR is
written with a pointer to the errant vector instruction, while the
`vstart` CSR contains the element index that caused the trap to be
taken.

NOTE: We chose to add a `vstart` CSR to allow resumption of a
partially executed vector instruction to reduce interrupt latencies
and to simplify forward-progress guarantees.  This is similar to the
scheme in the IBM 3090 vector facility.  To ensure forward progress
without the `vstart` CSR, implementations would have to guarantee an
entire vector instruction can always complete atomically without
generating a trap.  This is particularly difficult to ensure in the
presence of strided or scatter/gather operations and demand-paged
virtual memory.

=== Precise vector traps

Precise vector traps require that:

. all instructions older than the trapping vector instruction have committed their results
. no instructions newer than the trapping vector instruction have altered architectural state
. any operations within the trapping vector instruction affecting result elements preceding the index in the `vstart` CSR have committed their results
. no operations within the trapping vector instruction affecting elements at or following the `vstart` CSR have altered architectural state except if restarting and completing the affected vector instruction will recover the correct state.

We relax the last requirement to allow elements following `vstart` to
have been updated at the time the trap is reported, provided that
re-executing the instruction from the given `vstart` will correctly
overwrite those elements.

NOTE: We assume most supervisor-mode environments will require precise
vector traps.

Except where noted above, vector instructions are allowed to overwrite
their inputs, and so in most cases, the vector instruction restart
must be from the `vstart` location. However, there are a number of
cases where this overwrite is prohibited to enable execution of the
the vector instructions to be idempotent and hence restartable from
any location.

=== Imprecise vector traps

Imprecise vector traps are traps that are not precise.  In particular,
instructions newer than `*epc` may have committed results, and
instructions older than `*epc` may have not completed execution.
Imprecise traps are primarily intended to be used in situations where
reporting an error and terminating execution is the appropriate
response.

NOTE: A platform might specify that interrupts are precise while other
traps are imprecise.  We assume many embedded platforms will only
generate imprecise traps for vector instructions on fatal errors, so
do not require resumable traps.

=== Selectable precise/imprecise traps

Some platforms may choose to provide a privileged mode bit to select
between precise and imprecise vector traps.  Imprecise mode would run
at high-performance but possibly make it difficult to discern error
causes, while precise mode would run more slowly, but support
debugging of errors albeit with a possibility of not experiencing the
same errors as in imprecise mode.

=== Swappable traps

Another trap mode can support swappable state in the vector unit,
where on a trap, special instructions can save and restore the vector
unit microarchitectural state, to allow execution to continue
correctly around imprecise traps.

This mechanism is not defined in the base vector ISA.

== Divided Element Extension ('Zvediv')

NOTE: EDIV is the mostly likely part of the spec to change
substantially.

The divided element extension allows each element to be treated as a
packed sub-vector of narrower elements. This provides efficient
support for some forms of narrow-width and mixed-width arithmetic, and
also to allow outer-loop vectorization of short vector and matrix
operations.  In addition to modifying the behavior of some existing
instructions, a few new instructions are provided to operate on
vectors when EDIV > 1.

NOTE: This is written as an extension for now, but could become
part of mandatory base in Unix vector profile.

The divided element extension adds a two-bit field, `vediv[1:0]` to
the `vtype` register.

include::vtype-format.adoc[]

The `vediv` field encodes the number of ways, _EDIV_, into which each
SEW-bit element is subdivided into equal sub-elements.  A vector
register group is now considered to hold a vector of sub-vectors.

|===

Each implementation defines a minimum size for a sub-element, _SELEN_,
which must be at most 8 bits.

NOTE: While _SELEN_ is a fourth implementation-specific parameter,
values smaller than 8 would be considered an additional extension.

=== Instructions not affected by EDIV

The vector start register `vstart` and exception reporting continue to
work as before.

The vector length `vl` control and vector masking continue to operate
at the element level.

Vector masking continues to operate at the element level, so
sub-elements cannot be individually masked.

NOTE: SEW can be changed dynamically to enabled per-element masking
for sub-elements of 8 bits and greater.

Vector load/store and AMO instructions are unaffected by EDIV, and
continue to move whole elements.

Vector mask logical operations are unchanged by EDIV setting, and
continue to operate on vector registers containing element masks.

Vector mask population count (`vpopc`), find-first and related
instructions (`vfirst`, `vmsbf`, `vmsif`, `vmsof`), iota (`viota`),
and element index (`vid`) instructions are unaffected by EDIV.

Vector integer bit insert/extract, and integer and floating-point
scalar move instruction are unaffected by EDIV.

Vector slide-up/slide-down are unaffected by EDIV.

Vector compress instructions are unaffected by EDIV.

=== Instructions Affected by EDIV

==== Regular Vector Arithmetic Instructions under EDIV

Most vector arithmetic operations are modified to operate on the
individual sub-elements, so effective SEW is SEW/EDIV and effective
vector length is `vl` * EDIV.  For example, a vector add of 32-bit
elements with a `vl` of 5 and EDIV of 4, operates identically to a
vector add of 8-bit elements with a vector length of 20.

----
vsetvli t0, a0, e32,m1,d4  # Vectors of 32-bit elements, divided into byte sub-elements
vadd.vv v1,v2,v3                     # Performs a vector of 4*vl 8-bit additions.
vsll.vx v1,v2,x1                     # Performs a vector of 4*vl 8-bit shifts.
----

==== Vector Add with Carry/Subtract with Borrow Reserved under EDIV>1

For EDIV > 1, `vadc`, `vmadc`, `vsbc`, `vmsbc` are reserved.

==== Vector Reduction Instructions under EDIV

Vector single-width integer sum reduction instructions are reserved
under EDIV>1.  Other vector single-width reductions and vector
widening integer sum reduction instructions now operate independently
on all elements in a vector, reducing sub-element values within an
element to an element-wide result.

The scalar input is taken from the least-significant bits of the
second operand, with the number of bits equal to the number of
significant result bits (i.e., for sum and dot reductions, the number
of bits are given in table above, for non-sum and non-dot reductions,
equal to the element size).

----
# Sum each sub-vector of four bytes into a 16-bit result.
vsetvli t0, a0, e32,d4  # Vectors of 32-bit elements, divided into byte sub-elements
vwredsum.vs v1, v2, v3 # v1[i][15:0] = v2[i][31:24] + v2[i][23:16]
                       #              + v2[i][15:8] + v2[i][7:0] + v3[i][15:0]

# Find maximum among sub-elements
vredmax.vs v5, v6, v7 # v5[i][7:0] = max(v6[i][31:24], v6[i][23:16],
                      #                    v6[i][15:8], v6[i][7:0], v7[i][7:0])
----

Integer sub-element non-sum reductions produce a final result that is
max(8,SEW/EDIV) bits wide, sign- or zero-extended to full SEW if
necessary.

Integer sub-element widening sum reductions produce a final result
that is max(8,min(SEW,2*SEW/EDIV)) bits wide, sign- or zero-extended
to full SEW if necessary.

Single-width floating-point reductions produce a final result that is
SEW/EDIV bits wide.

Widening floating-point sum reductions produce a final result that is
min(2*SEW/EDIV,FLEN) bits wide, NaN-boxed to the full SEW width if
necessary.

==== Vector Register Gather Instructions under EDIV

Vector register gather instructions under non-zero EDIV only gather
sub-elements within the element.  The source and index values are
interpreted as relative to the enclosing element only.  Index values
{ge} EDIV write a zero value into the result sub-element.

----

       |       |       |  SEW = 32b, EDIV=4
        7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0  bytes
        d e a d b e e f  v1
        0 1 9 2 0 2 3 2  v2

                            vrgather.vi v4, v1, 1
        a a a a e e e e  v4
----

NOTE: Vector register gathers with scalar or immediate arguments can
"splat" values across sub-elements within an element.

NOTE: Implementations can provide fast implementations of register
gathers constrained within a single element width.

=== Vector Integer Dot-Product Instruction

The integer dot-product reduction `vdot.vv` performs an element-wise
multiplication between the source sub-elements then accumulates the
results into the destination vector element.  Note the assembler syntax
uses a `.vv` suffix since both inputs are vectors of elements.

Sub-element integer dot reductions produce a final result
that is max(8,min(SEW,4*SEW/EDIV)) bits wide, sign- or zero-extended
to full SEW if necessary.

                                            + vs2[i][15:8] * vs1[i][15:8]
                                            + vs2[i][7:0] * vs1[i][7:0]
----

=== Vector Floating-Point Dot Product Instruction

The floating-point dot-product reduction `vfdot.vv` performs an element-wise
multiplication between the source sub-elements then accumulates the
results into the destination vector element.  Note the assembler syntax
uses a `.vv` suffix since both inputs are vectors of elements.

                                           + vs2[i][15:0] * vs1[i][15:0]

# Floating-point sub-vectors of two half-precision floats packed into 32-bit elements.
vsetvli t0, a0, e32,m1,d2  # Vectors of 32-bit elements, divided into 16b sub-elements
