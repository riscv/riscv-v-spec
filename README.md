# riscv-v-spec
Working draft of the proposed RISC-V V vector extension.

[Version 1.0](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-v-spec/releases/tag/v1.0)
has been frozen and at this time is undergoing public review.
Version 1.0 is considered stable enough to begin developing
toolchains, functional simulators, and implementations, including in
upstream software projects, and is not expected to have incompatible
changes except if serious issues are discovered during
ratification. Once ratified, the spec will be given version 2.0.

The _previous_ stable releases are
[v1.0-rc2](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-v-spec/releases/tag/v1.0-rc2),
[v1.0-rc1](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-v-spec/releases/tag/v1.0-rc1),
[v0.10](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-v-spec/releases/tag/v0.10),
[v0.9](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-v-spec/releases/tag/0.9), and
[v0.8](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-v-spec/releases/tag/0.8).
Note, these previous releases were for experimental development purposes only and are not standard versions suitable for production use. Significant incompatible changes were made from these earlier versions prior to freezing.
